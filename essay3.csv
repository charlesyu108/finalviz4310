"my large jaw and large glasses are the physical things people
comment on the most. when sufficiently stimulated, i have an
unmistakable cackle of a laugh. after that, it goes in more
directions than i care to describe right now. maybe i'll come back
to this."
i smile a lot and my inquisitive nature
"i have a big smile. i also get asked if i'm wearing blue-coloured
contacts (no)."
i am the last unicorn
"i'm rather approachable (a byproduct of being from a small town in
the midwest)."
my huge goofy smile
""
""
you tell me:)
"physically-i've been told my eyes. people usually like how i can
turn a serious situation into something relaxing and fun. i tend to
make shy people ""talk"" to me...but i keep hearing that's a plus."
"blue eyes and a kind soul... although i don't really know that. i
haven't asked anyone. i imagine it's what they're thinking about at
the time: ""i could really go for a sandwich, oh wow, that guy's
carrying a sandwich from the local deli... wow he has really blue
eyes!"" so you know, maybe it's sandwiches."
"cheerful, open, curious, direct, active, sporty, energetic."
""
"my smile. my eyes, and my hair apparently."
that i'm smiling. pretty much at all times.
"scandinavian blond hair. i mean, that's what *you* noticed, right?
:)"
is how hard it is to pin point my ethnicity.
"depends. i've been told my eyes (isn't this the part where i'm
supposed to tell you they're ""piercing"" and that's supposed to be
good?)<br />
<br />
uh... if i've just come back from a camping trip, probably they
notice that i'm scruffy and covered in dirt. don't worry, i clean
up nice."
my use of profanity around children
my eyes. they're very green.
""
""
my smile.....or my ass :)
"i've never figured out the answer to this question. it really
depends on who the other person is and what i'm doing when they
meet me."
you'll have to tell me
""
""
"my big beautiful lips that will never need collagen injections. i'm
hilarious &amp; have been told by several idiots that i'm too smart
to be a woman. big tits, big brain. if you got it, flaunt it!<br />
<br />
where are all the sexy, funny, confident gals at? seriously."
"my eyes or maybe my charisma, depending on what setting i'm in."
you tell me!
""
"people generally can't discern my ethnicity...i get hawaiian,
samoan, or any other variety of pacific islander a lot and on
occasion got half-black and (insert guess here). my friends comment
on how approachable i am."
""
"my good vibe, my eyes, and some tallness"

i typically prefer to brew out of a sock (well, no, not
<em>that</em> kind of sock)."
i dunno... a lot of people point out my good posture. go figure.
"i'm always comfortable, even walking into a place where i don't
know anyone, or stepping off a plane in a foreign country. i will
talk to anyone. in fact, i enjoy starting conversations with
strangers. i find that the most interesting folks are never the
ones you would have guessed were interesting at all."
""
""
"my blue eyes, and that i look rather young for my age (sometimes
people think i'm in my mid-20s), hence why i set my match's upper
age bound to my age, since experience says that girls look someone
older.<br />
<br />
easy to start a conversation with, and enjoys a playful debate, but
occasionally gets tongue twisted"
i'm laughing at my own joke (or yours).
i wear a lot of bright colors in the wintertime?
the bright blue eyes and the dimples
i honestly couldn't say....
""
"people don't really notice me. i always blend into the background.
when they do notice me, they say ""wow, i didn't notice you there!"".
so, i guess the first thing people notice about me is that they
don't notice me.<br />
<br />
wrap your head around that one."
"friendliness, optimism, and spontaneity"
"i look a lot like that chick you banged your freshman year in
college. i am a honda civic."
i don't look my age. and good teeth.
smile and probably my accent.
obviously my hair.
my laugh...i'm pretty loud.
"besides the fact that i'm devilishly good looking:) i would say my
interest in learning about others and what makes them tick."
"i'd say my hair and my eyes. i would say my smile but i'm not
sure.<br />
i like my lips a lot tho."
"my really exotic brown hair and brown eyes. the leprosy, perhaps?"
i look like harry potter?
"probably my eyes? i'm not sure. i'm kind of oblivious when women
are checking me out... i guess that's why i'm here?"
"hair or clothes, or that i'm longboarding."
usually my smile or my blue eyes.
"my man boobs.<br />
<br />
actually, according to my good friend, my pumped up kicks steal all
the attention from her.<br />
<br />
i'm also told i remind them of phil in modern family."
"that i am a really laid back amiable kind of guy. although some
people have told me that i can be intimidating i don't see it at
all."
""
"my smile. my big brown eyes. my warmth. my general lioness like
qualities. my ability to listen deeply. my general lusciousness. my
powerful presence and creative intellect. and, i hear, my breasts ;
)"
eyes
my english accent
""
"my friendly demeanor, i always try to greet people with a smile.
i've also been told that i have ""eyes that sparkle from across the
room"" (thanks 60 year old lady from target) and an ""artistic face""."
"at first i think people consider me quiet and
reserved--professorial. i am actually fairly silly and trying not
to crack too many jokes."
my down to earth nature
i'm not going to say it's my eyes; that sounds cheesy.
""
my smile and sense of humor
""
dunno.
"hmm dunno. i'd like to say my lovely smile? but probably that my
hair is a mess (it's hard to control) and ive already forgotten
their name..."
"my name is unusual...also i've been told i have a familiar face,
which is awkward to hear from a law enforcement officer."
"my eyes, they are big and bright blue... then maybe my chest, they
are big... well you know."
""
my posture (straight). my walk (loud).
"i'm tall. people love to tell me that i'm tall. they'll go out of
their way to walk over to me and tell me that i'm tall as if i was
unaware of this. it's sort of a pet peeve of mine. if you take one
thing away from viewing this profile it should be this: don't ask
tall people how tall they are, they hate it."
my humor and my eyes
"my eyes, my smile, my shape."
my smile and my dimple.
""
i guess that would depend on who's looking.
"ok i finally asked one of my friends, who had me try again at this
internet dating ""option"". she says that i am ""very energetic with a
sweet demeanor. an approachable balance of warmth and wild."" i'd
agree. people also seem to think that i am steady and balanced mood
wise, which i think is only a form of my maturity, and they haven't
yet rowled me into a passionate fire quite yet. this takes time,
sometimes;)"
i'd wear sandals almost every day if i could get away with it.
"that i'm really chill and easy going but have a very sneaky sense
of humor."
"my attitude. my eyes and lips. my offspring which i know isn't
something about me but they are a part of me!"
""
""
my smile and height.
"i have a very unique timbre to my voice. it is not unsettling, but
even at normal volumes it has a way of slicing through ambient
sounds. if i am in a room with 20 people, and carrying on a
conversation with someone, almost everyone can hear and distinguish
my voice distinctly without me having to raise my voice at all. it
is a peculiar gift."
"i weigh arguments in my head and occasionally nod in agreement with
myself. it's noticeable."
my hair usually is the first thing people notice about me.
i tend to smile. and sometimes my pants.
i'm a sassy motherfucker.
hmmmm.......either my smile or maybe the hair?
i'm like amelie only bloned.
"my great smile. my loud ass radio (yes i drive alot). my animal
magnetism (literally) 4 legged strays and waifs tend to find me."
""
"that i'm down for most things (as long as no one gets hurt and
someone has fun), and that i'm open to new experiences (food,
activities, places, conversations, etc)."
"i'm energetic, curious, genuine, and usually up for anything... at
least once ;)."
my blue eyes and smile.
"are inconsequential.<br />
<br />
for example: i've heard many acquaintances comment that they are
surprised to hear me swear. i find it fascinating that they would
be surprised by this, but i suppose something about my first
impression threw them off. i'm trying to rectify this.<br />
<br />
things i feel contribute to this problem include:<br />
-i am older than i look.<br />
-i can be rather soft-spoken.<br />
-i am definitely more blunt than i seem after an initial
conversation.<br />
-i am much stronger than i look (really, you should arm wrestle
me)."
""
"my friend tells me that i'm independent and choose my words
carefully."
""
"i'll let you tell me, when we meet."
bedroom eyes or usually i get that guy from that movie.
i suppose it depends on the person looking.
"my stride, my walk.<br />
<br />
my intense energy. ""he's different!""<br />
<br />
my height - 6'3<br />
<br />
my ethnicity. ""is he asian, black or something else?"" something

<br />
and, my voice."
"smile, eyes and sense of humor. i love to laugh..."
eyes
""
my halo is crooked.
"freckles, i can't help the luck of the irish"
i have no idea - you tell me!
"first, my right arm and then, my left arm."
"my eyes, my teeth, my lips, my smile, my presence"
the first thing people notice is i have a really boring profile.
initially pretty reserved. not so much after a bit.
"my hair, always laughing and i kind of have a big laugh."
""
dunno...my eyes? my voice? both have happened...
"i dunno.never asked. i guess you'll have to tell me when you met
me.."
"my beautiful eyes, my perfect flawless skin and complexion, my
freakishly long fingers, my deep sexy voice and my adhd... and my
fucked up sense of humor.<br />
<br />
i don't look or act my age... i don't know if the latter is a
positive or negative asset? i actually never lie about my age...
except for on here."
my wicked gargoyle laugh. drops douchebags at 30 feet. truly.
my smile and my curly hair.
"i posed this question to my friends and they responded:<br />
""really tall, eccentric, bright smile""<br />
<br />
i'd like to think my affability and gregariousness."
""
""
""
"i have awesome legs. and i'm told i look like mario lopez. is that
a compliment?"
my bedroom eyes.
"people do not generally tell me what they first notice about me and
i don't really think to ask...<br />
but for one reason or another i end up in conversations with random
people easily..<br />
<br />
well my roommate just told me that when he first met me i was very
sociable, friendly, interested and engaging."
i don't know i have never asked anyone that question.
"the twinkle in my eyes and an enthusiasm towards life. the next is
my quick wit and a general openess to all people."
"i can often be found in places where it seems i don't belong,
whether i'm bringing down the average age of bingo players at a
rural vfw to 40 or watching my friend's heavy metal band as the
only patron wearing color."
the things that they always notice about others.
"how hard it can be to tell the difference between me joking and
being serious.....stick around and you'll figure it out."

why, but i have heard this since grade school."
""
that there's 2 of us
"my laugh; i do it often, and i'm told it's fairly distinctive."
""
"i cheeze a lot, people usually notice my smile. i try to stay fit
they might notice that. i am overall a very happy person, i think
people can tell that my life is going well before i say a word.."

"that i can and will talk to just about anyone. pretty <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=outgoing"">outgoing</a>. and that's good
news, because i can hold my own &amp; you don't have to babysit me
in whatever environment we're in. and every once in a
mustache-growing-phase, well....my mustache. they are pretty
ridiculous. i wish they weren't so creeper, i'd probably like to
have one more often :)"
is everything.
"my hair, if i'm not wearing a hat."
my calm aura and distinct laugh.
"unfortunately<br />
i seem to make a bad first impression.<br />
more than once people have told me<br />
(but only after they had changed their opinion) that they thought i
was a bitch.<br />
this leads me to wonder how many people<br />
have not changed their minds."

"1. ""can i bum a cigarette?"" (yes.)<br />

3. ""you talk really fast."" (yes??)<br />

conversation starter. if only."

my wing tattoos on my arms.

"i have various prize-winning body parts. yesterday a drag queen
rubbed my calves for good luck, and feet fetishists like me a lot.
i'm a bit off, only slightly kinda schizophrenic so hopefully you
are too and also have it under control. crazy people are not so
crazy."
"i get what they're saying and take them seriously.<br />
<br />
when not taking them seriously, i'm making jokes and trying add a
bit of hilarity to the moment.<br />
<br />
will vocalize whatever comes into my head (can be awkward, so i try
to squelch this, but it's nearly impossible).<br />
<br />
come off as a mad scientist, sometimes. some people dig that; i
can't control it.<br />
<br />
kick ass verbal skills. i ask a lot of questions, listen, and
remember what was said.<br />
<br />
heard too often - ""you're not like other guys who program - you're
actually fun and sociable."" a stereotype of the bunch, but sure,
i'll buy that. i still have that side though.<br />

gorgeous. but i'd like to think people notice my calm demeanor
first. ;-p"
"in order- height, boobs, face, legs."
"who knows? i always get mixed answers. sometimes it'll be my
bithmark on the left side of my forhead, other times it'll be my
brown eyes that turn lighter in the sun, sometimes it'll be how
quickly i get over my shyness around people that seem cool, i'll
leave that one up to you :)"

genuine, or my unique way of looking at (well) everything."
"it's my red beard, duh."
"i hear i have a great smile. followed by comments about my
orthodontia.... but compliments about my orthodontia were more
common when i lived in the uk.<br />
<br />
after that, i suppose it would have to be my stellar cat-herding
abilities, (non-obnoxious) laugh (really, it's lovely), dizzying
intellect and razor-sharp wit (have i scared you off yet?) and
perhaps height... even better in heels!"

until recently, i have maintained a hairstyle that could only be
described as 'curtainlike'. purposely cut to be uneven, it is long
in the front and unkempt just about everywhere else, but manages
some odd sense of neatness. my hair is thick, voluminous, and easy
to shape with minimal effort or upkeep. it is a point of pride for
me to admit that more than one girl has expressed jealousy for my
hair. within a month or two, my hair will return to its former
glory.<br />

""why is he in a suit?""<br />
i make it a point to dress nicely in social occasions, when i can
afford to. i am keenly aware that i'm not entirely pleasant to look
at, so the least i can do is make the effort to dress nicer than i
look. also, i dislike wearing denim, and you will never find me in
a pair of jeans.<br />
<br />
""holy crap what's wrong with your fingers.""<br />
only slightly exaggerated, but my fingers do draw some degree of

but i make no effort to shave my fingers."

i'm on the phone. (not proud.)
"first, my height, especially when i wear heels. second, how
extremely social and genuinely friendly i am. which has even led
some friends to comment on how challenging it is to cross a crowded
room with me."
my ravishing wit and stylish dress. i really have no idea...
"human female. unless they're blind. then it's my foot as i'm
tripping them."
"i dress like a lesbian.<br />
<br />
oh that's right!<br />
<br />
just so all of you know, i am actually a biological male. i didn't
put ""gay female"" to be a perverted douche who thinks lesbians are
blonde, femmy, sorority broads who have naked pillow fights that
always lead to hours of scissoring. no. i put ""gay female"" because
unfortunately(for me) i've always been attracted to, and dated
lesbians. i like my women androgynous, i like them in boy clothes,
and a dash of sexual ambiguity. there just isn't really an option
on okstupid for what i like. just to be clear though, i'm not
really after a type, per se. i've dated a few feminine, high
maintenance, straight girls too. i guess just be hot, haha.<br />
<br />
my taste in women probably stems from being raised by nothing but
women, lesbians, and gay men. if there was such a thing as a
male-identified-lesbian, i would be it.<br />
<br />
anyway..."
"that i remind them of someone else they know--friend's friend,
neighbor's cousin/nephew, old classmate. it's like i have an army
of doppelgangers out there crawling around the world.<br />
<br />
also, people always ask me what my ethnicity is. ""three
guesses.""<br />
<br />
side note: one of my best friends just realized what my ethnicity
is. she's had it wrong for six years. why do i keep her around..."
flying by on my bike w/ a pinata strapped to my back.
my smile and energy.
"no idea really. i've had an elderly woman tap on my shoulder and
tell me that i'm radiating immense energy. she seemed sane and
healthy. that was interesting."
let's hang out so you can tell me what i should put in here ;)
i mostly hear something about my hair and smile.
""
""
"eyes, kind smile...maybe that i am not wearing matching socks"
"probably that i talk too much, and too fast. either that or my
incredible handsomeness and suave demeanor."
"i have a good spirit. people tend to feel good around me because
i'm upbeat and open."
""
""
accent and eyes
my stilettos for all the wrong occasions
"depends on the circumstances and what kind of lense you view the
world through."
"my southern charm. ""oh i guarantee cher!"""
"my eyes.<br />
my fashion sense."
"i have a warm, friendly, and inviting smile, i'm not afraid of eye
contact, and a great sense of humor."
""
they usually notice my skin and hair.
my teeth :)
""
"my intellect and how articulate i am. i also am extremely
respectful to people. others have told me that i am quite handsome."
i am a friendly and talkative person.
apparently i have a large head.
"you tell me. do most people actually know the answer to this
question? i actually asked some people i met last night and one of
them told me my hair looked really soft haha."
""
"it's my smile and the dimples that go with it. after that, probably
my angular jawline. i'm a product of german engineering."
""
"they don't. my superhero power is invisibility. but sometimes my
awesome boots. or they think i'm several years younger than i
actually am."
"i've got my head in the clouds, but my feet on the ground."
my smile.
"not sure, you will have to let me know."
the giant pulsing tumor on my forehead.
"my afro....<br />
my smile?<br />
my individuality?<br />
probably my red hair :-)<br />
i dont know. you tell me."
my eyes
my extremely curly hair.
"i've been described as serious and shy, but i consider myself to be
quite silly and outspoken."
my smile
"very blue eyes, ever since i was a kid. but those are just lucky
genetics. the rest i'd say: sarcasm, extroverted personality, and
an excellent vocabulary."
"the surprising things that i say. sometimes they are funny,
sometimes they are smart, usually they are a little unbelievable."
"in terms of a physical feature, people notice my eyes a lot.<br />
personality-wise, i'm really not sure...friendly? funny?
inquisitive? it probably depends on the situation and what mood i'm
in."
my teeth. hopefully not because something is in them.
""
eyes?
"that people like me do exist who can converse on almost all the
topics !!"
"i have been told i am caring, full of energy, flexible, and
adventurous."
my hair
"my looks. (hey, we all do it, let's be honest here!)<br />
how incredibly nice/ interesting/ friendly/ intelligent i am."
"my height and my dimples. i think after people notice the
shortness, they then proceed to notice my disproportionate chest
size. i am not saying that to grab your attention, i am just
stating the truth."
my smile. my butt.
"my height or my smile!<br />
the thing that they remember the most is that they never met anyone
like me! :)"
"my dreads;<br />
i get checked everytime at the airport by security, and in utah
national parks too:(<br />
i get asked for ecstasy when im dancing although i never have any."
my smile and my booty.
"my smile and my singular dimple. strange, i know."
my glasses?
my dapper style.
""
""
"i'm very short, but interestingly, people often don't notice that
about me until much later. apparently, i ""don't act like a short
person,"" whatever that means..."
"physically i think people notice my smile and eyes first. people
ask me my nationality often. if someone takes the time to talk to
me they notice my dry sense of humor."
i think that would be my smile..
"the first thing people generally notice about me is my height &amp;
my smile"
""
"my smile... then my broad shoulders probably! ha! it's from all the
pull-ups naturally:)"
"i smile a lot, sometimes out of genuine sincerity, other times
plain nervousness, but mostly because i'm usually in a good mood."
my eyes and dimples
you tell me.
"people always expect me to be taller than i really am. 5' 8"" is
what is says up over on the right-hand side and that is the truth!
we can all wish me a little taller but i think that this is all i
am going to get, alas.<br />
<br />
he is cute, charming, loves ""firefly"" and that accent!! whoooo!
(fans herself with an ostrich feather fan) disarming!!!"
"i have a dragon tattoo on the side of my head also have a feminist
symbol in the other side. i have tigerstripes on my left forearm
and a fairy covering the whole of my left calf. and i have 4
tattoos on my chest. people stare at my chest a lot. they must
really like my tattoos. that's what they are staring at right? i
also am known as an international free hugs girl. i can be seen in
warmer weather with a free hugs sign...and i have a sweatshirt with
free hugs lesbian emblazoned on the back. im tall and dainty and
really sexy anf hot and dont have an ego at all. haha...im a
sweetheart and try to be a good person."
"i have a small space in between my front teeth but in a charming
way, not in a cletus from simpsons kinda way. that and i look great
in clothes. (i look better without them)"
"""you ride a motorcycle?""<br />
<br />
""no. i'm accident prone."""
you tell me. :)
"i was riding my bicycle somewhere and stopped at a light on market
street, and a bigger bearded guy in a ford explorer suv pulled up
to me and said: ""nice butt....."", then, after a lengthy pause:
"".....i'd lick that"". otherwise, i have no idea."
"i really don't know actually i've heard my laugh is pretty
identifiable, but i'm not sure what else"
"they usually say ""hey! you're that guy from okcupid! can you sign
my forehead??"""
i am a man of style.
"people always tell me i have a great face. idk what that means, but
i'll take it :)"
""
""
"i've never met myself so this is difficult to say. appearance-wise,
i think i'm quite unremarkable, but i've had people i don't ever
remember meeting recognize me from years before. so either i'm
memorable somehow or i get amnesia every few years."
he almost seems human.
"is my gnome-like height, excessively high energy level, and then my
silly sense of humor. ( i pretty much laugh at everything.)"
nice hazel eyes
""
my smile...
some strange article of clothing i've decided to wear
my warm inviting smile.
"i have a twin, and we're really close. so people sometimes say we
talk about each other a lot. i suppose there are worse criticisms!"
my long-term relationship potential.
perhaps i should ask...
""
that i dress well
my peter gallagher eyebrows.
uh.. i've been told i have really nice hair?
""
"my friends tell me i'm very animated with a highly expressive face,
but i'm not sure that's the first thing people notice. eyelashes,
maybe?"
"honestly i don't know, probably my ethnicity."
"i'm quiet. but people don't realize i've got a sassy commentary
running in my brain, no one is exempt."
"my broad shoulders, white teeth, and butt."
my eyes and my smile. but i guess you should ask them.
"my eyes, my smile, my laugh and my passionate nature."
"""what kind of mutt is this?""<br />
i get ""middle eastern"" and ""hispanic"" more than anything else, but
i'm actually pertalian (persian/italian). i can never find that box
on the census.<br />

ever"
eyes and smile...
"probably my glasses. i dont know. what kind of a question is this
anyway... you sir reader probably know the answer to this better
than i do.<br />
<br />
more likely... people don't notice me.. which is fine. i like to do
my work in the shadows anyway. spotlight makes me nervous"
my hair.
"probably my long, wavy hair and then my bright, nomadic soul...
that i laugh at my own jokes?<br />
<br />
i'm pretty outgoing once you get to know me, and i laugh at almost
anything."
i don't know you tell me.

"my eyes and smile...i'm also tall, at about 5'9"""
my booming personality
"my smile! i have also been told a bizarre amount of times that i
have a nice nose, whatever that means."
"a lot of people say i look like a young david bowie. or a young jon
bon jovi. one time, someone said i looked like tom petty. i was
pretty offended by that one. all in all, i guess the first thing
people notice about me is that i kind of look like a 70's rockstar."
my shining personality and matching smile
"in person: my nose and my laugh<br />
on the internet: i can't take a picture to save my life"
i'm tall and i make terrible puns sometimes.

rounded. i have a degree in both statistics and french, and i'm
usually pretty knowledgeable about current events, so i can
typically hold a good conversation.<br />

my sense of humor can also be rather blunt. it might take a bit of
time to know when i'm joking but i've close friends who find my
sense of humor unique."

plugs."
"i don't really know what others notice but my friend here says,
""you have your shit together and you have an infectious smile and
laugh."""
"my smile. people have told me i'm a good listener, intellectually
astute, and have spiritual wisdom. people who know me over time
notice how affectionate i can be. some people are surprised at how
i don't suffer binary oppositions or assumptions lightly."
"i appear to be much younger than my chronological age.<br />
i tend to be socially reserved, but, i'm a very good listener and a
peace keeper. i'm non-judgmental, willing to give advice, but never
force my opinions on others."

i'm not yao ming status or anything but i am taller than most of

you meet me, you can tell me what you first notice about me.
hopefully, it's something good =p"

told me that i was easy to talk to and my openness made it easy to
blossom a friendship. a lot of people are shocked when they find
out i'm gay, which i try to establish immediately with anyone i
meet. others have said that i have a sort of brashness that they
found entertaining. some people really like my blonde hair. i think
it really depends on who you are."
"i'm tall, i like to smile and i'm easy to talk to. i find that
people confide in me almost immediately, which tells me they can
sense how genuine i am right off the bat."
i laugh a lot :)
you tell what you noticed first thing about me when we meet :)
"i guess this isn't the place to be humble. the first thing people

i am not sure. what do you notice first?
"wow, he started a conversation with me.<br />
<br />
i hear that i have a good smile"
"i'm shockingly serious and deadpan, at least initially. if you've
got a good sense of humor then that will sort itself out naturally."
"my eyes, my wit and my seeming shyness -- which is funny cuz i am
anything but..."
not sure.
""
everyone is different . my eyes maybe and my sense of humor.
""
"not real sure about that one?....i'd like to say that i've seen
myself walking down the street one time and couldnt help but to
notice what an attractive human i was...let's just say my pretty
blue eyes."
""
probably the way i'm staring at their food
""
my good looks
"smile, friendly,open-minded:), confidence...and my fit body..."
"first thing people notice about me, is that i am originally from
another country. been here for a bit..10 yrs."
i am tiny. please find me
my incredible charm and good looks.
"my sense of humor and passion for life. i wish i could say i was
super adventurous but i'm really not. maybe i'm looking for someone
to make my life match my personality."
"my sense of stylewhile i'm not a shopaholic, i do enjoy dressing
well and well-dressed men.<br />
<br />
i may be petite but have a big personality."
"my smile. a fortune cookie once read, ""smile, it makes people
wonder what you're thinking."" it's so true, and they're contagious."
i'm asian...? and sometimes i have my blonde moments =d
"perhaps that i'm tall, handsome, intense, and articulate... and
then maybe that my smile is boyish and kind of goofy. and i'm not
just full of myself; if i love you i'll be full of you, too!<br />
<br />
after a while they might notice that i'm a critic of reality..."
i would say my eyes or my smile
you will have to let me know...
""
maybe my smile?
my fashion accessories and my desire to have a good time.
"my smile, which you will see quite often"
eyes...but i usally get you look just like ta leoni
"my hair, and my smile"
my eyes and facial expressions
"personality, hair, smile, energy, and kaarraazzma... ;)"
positive and chill attitude.
my young voice.
my smile and my eyes
"- authentic<br />
- positive/optimistic attitude<br />
- easy going<br />
- consistent"
"people always say i have beautiful skin and hair. my friends love
me because i am kind and funny."
i have a gap in my teeth.
"the way i look, dress, and act is what they notice about me."
my machete!
that i say it like it is.

my toothy grin :d
""
"my green eyes<br />
... and my curves ;)<br />
i'm of average height, 5' 7"" --<br />
not thin or athletic -- but soft, curvy, and feminine.<br />
<br />
the winter brought me 15 extra pounds --<br />
so my curves are bigger than i'd prefer right now!<br />
but i'm good at losing weight when i put my mind to it."
trying to figure out what my ethnicity is...
i guess it would be...my height??
my hair... the curls and that fact i still have it
"my dry sense of humor, quirks, sarcasm, cynicism, red-brown hair,
and facial expressions."
"i'm tall. even though i try to be humorous and outgoing some have
told me that i'm intense, almost to the point of being
intimidating, i don't intend to be, most of the time, i think it
comes from growing up in brooklyn.<br />
<br />
that said i haven't had trouble with anyone since i was barely
teenager, so i'm not complaining."
let me go ask...
my awesome roommates. they really are the best.
"my smile and my full head of white hair . i can remind people that
i have whilte hair like the movie actor peter graves ( a very
distant relative) who was the head of the mission impossible -- a
tv show from many years ago."
"i get a lot of comments on my smile, so i assume i have a good
smile lol<br />
<br />
my no-nonsense personality. my goofiness and yet seriousness. my
ability to roll with the punches! ... i'm always cracking jokes in
random conversation.<br />
<br />
my ""new yawk"" accent when i'm excited or around other east
coasters.<br />
<br />
sometimes i can come off a bit intimidating, perhaps because i
don't walk around smiling.... i'm from ny. don't be scared lol"
"smile, eyes, energy and bluh bluh ;)"
i'm really good at hiding my only-child characteristics
"i'm not as tall as them. i am still amazed by tall peoples ability
to reach things without having to climb on chairs or counters."
"this is a tough one, i've never asked! probably that i am outgoing
and friendly...and my dead fish-like handshake."
"opinionated. sweet. sassy. clever. and my baby blues, or at least
people comment on them a lot."
"some funny t-shirt i'm wearing, or my saucy sense of humor."
"i think people notice first that i am tall, but i often wonder what
they think first of me personality wise."
"are my denim vests. one has a big back patch of my favorite band,
exodus!!! another thing would be my t-shirts. usually i wear shirts
with logos from many of the metal bands i listen to."
"hahahahahaha. i thought of all the inappropriate ones first. just
how inappropriate can i be on here? let's go with eyes. i have blue
eyes. they'll stare into your soul. i should prolly keep them
locked up like cyclops. not really, i don't have lasers in 'em."
"dunno... i try not to get noticed, but sh!t happens i do something
dumb and there ya go..."
"my friendliness. that i smile a lot. that i'm pop culture
illiterate. easy to get along with. easy-going. that i have a
strong work ethic. that i process things and then act. that i ask a
lot of questions. when i put my mind to something, i go at it 100%."
""
"most people find me friendly and easy to talk to. they say i have a
great smile and a fun personality."

they are like...really..?? u don't look like from there...!!...and
i'm like....good that's what i want."

not--i look like my pics ;)."
my hair or my eyebrows.

"i'm outgoing and i generally love to meet new people. also, i
smile. a lot. and i guess people are into that?"
""
my eyes.
i'm smarter than i look
maybe my accent?
my smile :)
that's a tough one. i'll have to ask next time :)
"my smile? i laugh a lot, i'm always afraid i laugh too much, but i
find a lot of things funny. if you can't make me laugh, you are
boring. (not you!)"
"people notice that i'm very open...<br />
<br />
and that i have a nice ass"
um.... my freckles?

"that i am friendly and kind, happy, out going and funny."
""
""
laugh or the red hair.
"my eyes, my hair, my sense of humour"
my eyes
"i think it would probably be my smile or laugh. i use them often
and they go hand in hand. people tell me they ""still remember my
laugh"" or ""can hear me laughing"" in their head. hopefully it's not
a nice way of saying you have a horrible laugh!"
""
"when i'm fortunate enough to be hanging around my bff and sister
people often stop and ask, ""are you... twins!?"" and we laugh and
say together, ""yes! we're identical twins!"" and they laugh and say,
""i thought so!!"" then all the weird questions follow like ""do you
hurt when she hurts? can you read each other's mind? did you get
your first period together on the same day?"", stuff like that."
my sense of humor.
"kind, sense humor, honest."
my hand gestures.
my eyebrow ring. my witchly green eyes. my smile.
probably my red hair and smile.
"i can't pin point one thing about me but people tend to remember me
often. even when i can't remember them at all. maybe my height? i
am short. but not freakishly-short. average-short? fun-sized?"
""
"the honest answer is it depends; i'll save this for a later
conversation."
green eyes
"apparently i laugh a lot. i guess i just find a lot of things
funny."
"not sure... i think different people notice different things. don't
know if there is a theme. i hang in different enviroments/circles.."
they don't notice me... i'm lurking in the shadows. ;-)
"i look better in person than in my pics.<br />

i'm a nice guy. i'm a nerd. i'm fun. i'm not judgmental. i'm smart.
i'm not stuck-up. i help my friends. i value beauty.<br />

it."
"keen wit, attractive, insightful and articulate."
""
smile
"is often the thing that makes a first impression. like when i drop
an anvil on someone's head, or how i'm not really there and you
find that your thinking of me spontaneously and wonder why. it's
probably because i shared my special talent with you...."
no idea... my face?
my blue eyes get a lot of attention.
my eyes...
"it has to be my smile. i'm always finding ways to laugh and smile,
no matter the situation."
""
"the first thing guys notice about me is me smiling a lot. if they
have courage to come to talk to me, they find out how nice person i
really am :p"
i'm actually a camel.

i'm pretty casual.
me and my infectious personality. my laugh. goofiness.
"my laugh i'm told that it make people smile or laugh just from
hearing it"
i have big holes in my ears
"i have a good sense of humor and and my smile .... people also seem
to find my race a bit of a question mark. i'll try almost anything
once."
""
why does this dude talk so much?
"my tattoos (i have some big ones, but tasteful) and my height. i'm
pretty short for a guy. maybe my long eyelashes and hazel eyes, i
get that a lot."
"probably my hard to pick accent -- a bit of an odd mix between
australian and new zealander. (this doesn't stop my friends back
home in nz labeling me as a traitor having picked up a slight
australian twang in sydney!)"
"cuteness, and lack of eye contact."
i might be a wee bit on the tall side?
my empowered charisma
"i assume from comments i get... my glasses, my hair, and my style."
that i'm tall and that i'm a man :)
""
jew curls.
probably my neck scar?

"my smile, my hair, or the most recent burn that i have recieved in
my very dangerous line of work."
i smile a lot and love to have fun.
"my eyes, my accent (brit + irish a bit) ..... there is a hint of
nerd in me .. it comes in my job description hehe ... im not a
womanizer, but certainly know how to keep up a conversation"
"that i look 10 years younger than my age. well, thats what people
tell me . then its my smile and hands."
"i don't know about the first thing people notice, but if you get to
know me well, it should slowly occur to you that i <em>never</em>
wear shorts."
"really?! you've only seen a picture of my face so i'd have to say
either my smile or eyes. in person probably my sarcasm if it's
beyond the physically obvious notion that i exist in the same
dimension as them."
""
""
"i get comments about my smile and my self confidence.<br />
that i bop around to background music."
"not in any particular order: my smile, my charming wit, and my
bite."
"what people comment to me on: my friendliness, my smile,
intelligence."
my hair. it's a blinding beacon of light.
"the eyes. or the hair. or the walk. sometimes the smile.
periodically, the falling off-of-heels.<br />
<br />
actually, it really varies with the situation. i swing from wildly
charming to downright chilly depending on how comfortable i am in
any given social environment. i run the gamut from
lurking-in-corners-with-a-mysterious-air to
dancing-on-tables-half-clothed, depending on who i'm with.<br />
<br />
i have green-grey eyes that penetrate your soul. that's right -
deep in there. that spitball you thought no one noticed in 3rd
grade? i see it."
""
"my smile? the fact that i'm not facing the camera in my main photo?
i'm not sure."
""
"smile, tall, nice .. sexy ..."
probably my smile? that's something for them to answer.
"probably the combination of my eyes and glasses. it's hard to
explain, so see for yourself."
"eyes, lack of height."
"height<br />
lack of social skills"
""
"probably my blue eyes which i can't take credit for, thanks
grandpa!"
"my blue eye's, and the fact that i'm tall."
"i smile a lot. people often tell me i make great eye contact, which
i always assumed was required for conversations."
"i'm probably making them laugh unexpectedly and feel better about
themselves. my zen is infectious, i'm like an anti anxiety bomb
with a consistent effect."
my lucky charms. my radness.
people normally think i am a little too serious and my smile.
""
assuming the person isn't blind: how i look.
"unusual facial hair. currently i'm sporting ""friendly muttonchops"",
which i grew sort of for the edwardian ball, but decided to
continue rocking. my go-to is wicked big sideburns though"
"probably that i'm always smiling or laughing...or looking like i'm
up to something. i can usually find the funny in anything - even
when it's not necessarily appropriate - so i do laugh a ton."
""
"i've been told i'm unique looking. a lot of people comment on my
big eyes. i'm also often asked about my ethnic background and have
gotten some fun guesses. most people say i have a great smile (and
ass) as well :)"
"my warmth and openness (provided i am not caught in my thinking -
which it does happen sometimes)"
"im 6 foot 7 or 2 meters. a school age girl outside of the beijing
airport called me godzilla. also, my hair color is currently blue,
green and black so i am rather easy to spot. once a group of
tourists asked if they could take their picture with me."
i usually carry a helmet around with me.
most likely my eyes
"my eyes are <em>extremely</em> blue. i get a lot of comments about
them. i know that it's cliche, but it's the truth."
i wear glasses and smile a lot.
""
smile
my smile
"red hair, blue eyes, awkward demeanor."
i been told my smile :)
"i'd have to say the baby face, i guess. i just finished grad school
but could have easily passed as an undergrad on campus.<br />
<br />
some people . . . the quite observant ones . . . notice that
whenever there is trouble in metropolis, i always ask where the
nearest phone booth is located and quietly slip away from the
crowd."
""
""
"hm. i don't really ask. when it's dyed, i suppose people notice my
bright red/purple hair."
my hair! i have too much of it.
haven't you noticed yet?
"i'm not sure i usually see them first. i get a lot of compliments
on my eyes so i think i'll go with eyes. even better, you tell me!"
"my bright orange messenger bag. it contains my laptop, my gym
clothes (so i have no excuse not to go!) and my kindle. more often
than not, i'm carrying it with me wherever you might run into me.
when i'm not carrying it, you'll notice one of my brightly colored
shirts. (i try not to clash too much with the messenger bag, what
can i say.)"
dr. jang tells me i have really nice teeth.

"my smile, my back, and that my voice goes up a few octaves when i
drink."
"my smile, i enjoy putting a smile on people's faces."
it might be stuttering. it varies though.
my voice. it carries.
my friends often describe me as energetic and fun.
"small person, big personality, bigger laugh"
"sense of humor, petite, fun,.. with big brown eyes :)"
"my big smile. then... depending on my outfit... certain things
about my body which they may choose or choose not to comment on and
then, depending on their choices at the two aforementioned noticing
points, my cunning linguistic ability."
"i have no idea, let me know when you meet me."
definitely how young i look... but since when was that a bad thing
i think you should ask them
"hmm... not really sure. glasses? you tell me. what i hear most
often, from people i don't know, is that i come across as being
quiet. i really do enjoy having conversations, however, and i can
talk about literally anything when i have a good partner."
my smile maybe? or maybe the few strands of grey hair. =)
"that i shave my head,,,,"
you probably hear me long before you see me.
i smile a lot (and only stop joking while at work...sometimes).
i'm racially ambiguous.

greeting"

i'm southern but i'm also a total dork.<br />
i love a good ol' boy but i've got a crude humor and am in no way
conservative."
""
"i'm pretty sure i smile a lot... i'm a believer in the talking
heads song seen and not seen. i try to hold a warm and bright
energy, so hopefully that, and keep my eyes dark to make for better
swimming.<br />
<br />
i'll tell you a secret though, i can be sort of mutable, the intp
thing. i mirror, i can't help it. kids are really comfortable
around me. airheads or people that like to be manipulated or spun
are not because i don't really do that."
"that i remind them of someone. i must have a bunch of doppelgangers
running around."
""
"i laugh really easy. if you want to play that game where you stare
at each other/keep a straight face, i'm going to throw in the towel
right now."
my smile and my eyes
"in oklahoma: that i'm skinny.<br />
in the netherlands: that i'm short.<br />
in michigan: that my hair is no longer purple.<br />
in mexico: probably that i don't deal with heat too well, but that
i love lots of throttle.<br />
in snow: that i'm endlessly happy."

the first things people notice about me ... that and my eyes, which
everyone seems to comment on."

i assume that's what they first notice. i think they also generally

my long, flowing locks and old testament beard."

bird froze up and fell to the ground in a large field. while it was
lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on it. as the
frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, it began to realize
how warm it was. the dung was actually thawing him out! he lay
there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy.<br />
<br />
a passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate.
following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of
cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him!""<br />

interesting and noteworthy: ...it seems that i am almost always
attracted to the women who score as the hippie! so if that's you,
then you have solved the riddle before the puzzle was presented! i
also seem to have a phenomenal affinity for jewish women, which is
also fine by me and poses no issues whatsoever.<br />
<br />
in one of the funny tests here called the personality defect test i
scored as a ""hand raiser."" this is the funny result of that test.
:-)<br />
<br />
""you are the hand-raiser, that annoying kid in class who always had
an answer for everything. no doubt, as a child you probably sat in
the front of the class, anxiously waving your hand back and forth
in the air while your teacher desperately tried to avoid calling on
you because you were the only fucking kid that answered her
questions. clearly, the key traits of your personality are your
rationality and your extroversion. you are like a little talkative
calculator, in other words. you also tend to be rather gentle and
less arrogant than most people. your presence is a bane to
everyone's existence, because you are too nice for your own good
and you absolutely will not shut up. so what is your defect, then?
well, you're boring, and when you're not boring, you are just plain
annoying with your ultra-logical responses and constant need to
talk to others. so keep waving that hand in the air, son. i'm still
not calling on you. you are too logical, you talk too much, and
your humility and gentleness only makes me hate you more, because
they make me feel like i almost shouldn't hate you. but i do. big
time! and by the way, the more you wave your hand in class--your
extended hand becoming nothing more than a blur as you insanely
wave it, thinking we can't see it--the more smug satisfaction the
teacher takes in watching the look of excruciating pain cross your
face as you agonize over not being called on, and the longer we'll
wait to call on you, just because we absolutely love torturing you
so. ""<br />
<br />
by the way... let me note for the record, yes, i was indeed that
child, however, i didn't always have the right answer, so that
helped temper the degree to which others hated me, since it was
always a crap-shoot whether i was displaying a moment of
brilliance, or a moment of utter desperate catastrophe! :-)"

my attire it seems or my laugh.... its kinda loud and infectious.
"my pretty long hair, cute chubby cheeks, my big earnings and my
loud mouth."

my great smile
"my rings: there are only 2 reactions that i've seen. some people
are fascinated and love them, other people are completely horrified

if someone actually takes the time to talk to me they are quick to
find a positive attitude a good sense of humor a giving nature and
a very different outlook on life<br />

my nails. they're long, they're sharp. they're useful<br />
it's not a common look to say the least but i love the way it looks
and that's what matters most<br />
<br />
i've also been told i have nice eyes but i'm almost always wearing
sunglasses (well at least outdoors anyway) so it's a little hard to
tell it was also mentioned on several occasions that i have a nice
ass but alas my coat is usually be obscuring it :p"

notice."

brighten up their day"

somehow they came out all right. not that you can tell with the
pictures i have posted, but anyway ... oh yeah, most people also
probably notice i use a lot of ellipses when i write."
hmm. i should ask.
feel free to tell me if we meet.
"if they are paying attention, my nuanced wit. if they aren't, then
i don't know-- probably that i am under dressed.<br />

i've also been told that i smile with my eyes."

"my eyes, it's the most common compliment i ever get."
"why does everyone always say ""my eyes"" here. my daddy always told
me to look someone in the eye when i meet them so i feel like this
is a little obvious. that said, my half asian half irish mix makes

got to my profile was check out the photos, so you tell me, i
guess:)"

my height and my very curly hair.

"i've received a compliment or two on my big blue eyeballs. and
butt! one time an argentinian ex-basketball-pro/male-model coworker
told me he admired my shoulders, so that's probably worth something
to someone (someone weird who cares about shoulders, that is)."
my heavy russian accent &amp; ak-47
"it depends on whether i'm coming (my smile) or going (girlfriend
has a booty)...."
is my fucked up sense of humor.
i have hair.
"i'm tall especially for an asian female. i stand 5'9.5"". please
only contact me if you will stand straight and be taller than me."

morning<br />

"either the scent of the double dry cappuccino in my left hand or
the obnouxious jangle of my absurd set of keys (seriously they
would challenge the janitor of the moma) in my right. i never
finish the cappuccino, but always order another and i have no clue
what half of the keys open. my desire to schlep things i don't
need...that's the first thing people usually (or should) notice
about me"

<br />
my smile, energy, confidence, physicality. i am a very <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=happy"">happy</a> person in general.
people are often surprised that i walk down the street with a smile
on my face. before people see me, though, i think they see my
energy--which is abundant--playful, and sometimes intense.
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=intensity"">intensity</a> is
something i always notice about people. i am very drawn to
it.<br />
<br />
another thing people comment to me about is my <a class=""ilink""
href=""/interests?i=confidence"">confidence</a>. a very good friend
once asked me how he could develop the kind of confidence i had,
wondered what my secret was. i told him that i had been put down a
lot growing up and that it forced me to find things that i liked
about myself and to focus on those as if my life depended on it. in
addition, i found that there were quite a lot of things that i was
naturally interested in and motivated to develop skills in, some of
which were terrifying, like speech and debate, singing, writing and
acting. eventually i developed a sort of confidence based on real
world skills, and--after having had a long look at my
flaws--committing myself fully to becoming a person that i
liked.<br />
<br />
the physicality is innate. i am very <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=kinesthetic"">kinesthetic</a>; i like to learn
anything movement oriented, whether it is <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=dance"">dance</a>, <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=martial+arts"">martial arts</a>, comedy, massage. i am
very body-centered, like to stretch, feel comfortable, challenge
myself. i haven't been a runner for many years but every so often i
like to sprint down the block just to get that feeling of flight
and to test myself to see if i can still do it with ease and grace.
i love to move and feel totally free in my body. that to me is the
gift of vibrant health. it takes care and maintenance, but feeling
strong, agile and relaxed is the cornerstone to a healthy life."
"i am sweet, generous and love to have a good time."
"not sure, i guess you'll have to tell me."
eyes and teeth.
"obviously, my incredible charm.<br />
<br />
and then that i'm kind of tall.<br />
<br />
then sometime much later the fact that all those dead pan remarks
were actually really hilarious jokes."
"my kid, my energy...the light"
"my infectious laughter, for which there is no vaccine. it will
infect you like polio, steal your legs and steal your soul."
my smile and i'm told my laugh is pretty infectious
"i've got a nice smile.<br />

*smile*"
"my dark curly hair<br />
my smile<br />
my loud laugh"
"i'm somewhat short (or vertically-challenged, whatever you prefer),
and sometimes need help getting things from tall shelves or
cabinets (my natural enemy).<br />
<br />
friends say that i'm well-dressed, and have a pretty good sense of
style. some say that i'm pretty easy to read, while others claim
i'm hard to read. eh, to each their own.<br />

let me know what you first notice!"
""
"my smile, my lips, my eyes and my lovely rack. ;)"
"my eyes (depending on what i'm wearing) -- they're an unusual shade
of blue that seems to catch people's attention."
"first - my height.<br />
<br />
after that - i'm usually engaged in animated conversation - with
friends or whoever happens to be sitting near me. i can get really
excited about a subject and have been known to get whole tables and
bars involved. this can be really fun or really annoying to
romantic partners, but i'm pretty good about picking up on that and
finding a happy medium."
my voice
"i really don't know. height, enthusiasm, swedishness.. ?"
"probably my foreign accent - and then how well i speak english - i
get the second one a lot."
"very social and friendly, with a post-kantian smile."
"it would likely be that i debunk the ""blonde bimbo myth"". i don't
twirl my hair and i'm not overly concerned about reapplying my
lipstick."
"never asked the question to anyone, but i'm going to assume my
eyes.<br />
<br />
apparently i'm a good conversationalist. i feel like this is only
mildly good spin on ""knows lots of random trivia and will point it
out with sometimes annoying frequency"", but eh, i'll take what i
can get."
i am random. you probably noticed this already.
"my hair some and my dialect. guess what country?<br />
it is not germany."
"some people notice my eyes (they're brown, but with some green in
them). other people have said i'm a nice, level-headed guy. some
said i was sweet and friendly, yet others have said i was really
shy. i guess it all depends on the situation."
my smile and my laugh! and my hair!
that i don't look italian and that 'gasp!' i don't have an accent!
i always have something to laugh about.
"i'll be honest, i'm a terrible judge of other peoples' opinions of
me."
my huge fucking beard and my pink shoes. how loud i am.
people tell me that i look like a super duper nice person!
"my height. then my massive blue eyes. then my ass... though i
suppose eyes and ass are interchangeable depending on which
direction you spot me from first."

to wear cute dresses and heels and sparkly bracelets when i go out,
so i usually get a few compliments..."

often assume it's a hicky. ;-)"

its too late. *snap neck, steal gun*"

black tying up the heroine to railroad tracks. i'm really not like
that. it's just the laugh."
"maybe that my hair is in a funny position because i just took my
bike helmet off?"
"that's a weird one to answer. i'm not looking through their eyes. i
would prob give a really lame answer and say my curly hair."

you tell me when you meet me!
"my tattoos. i have a 3/4 sleeve on my left arm and some more on my
legs, chest and wrist and there will most likely be more but i
don't get tattoos i cant cover up with every day clothes"

when i speak."

curiosity is often confused with judgement) and that i want to hear

the meaning (or lack of meaning) of life, then we'll be talking for
hours.<br />

that too..."

everything else about me. really, it's fascinating. when it's not,
then they notice my smile and my laugh - i smile and laugh a lot."

usually assume i'm a snob because i wear proper clothes all
the<br />
time instead of wearing sportswear to not play sport like
everybody<br />
else. i just think it's disrespectful to dress for comfort
instead<br />
of fashion, and i think it's pathetic for a grown man to dress

they've found intimidating) or a boyhood friend's girlfriend they
always wanted to steal, or a cheerleader ""frenemy"" they thought was
pretty but dumb. if the conversation goes longer than about five
minutes, they get over it, most often declaring me 'normal,' like
maybe that's not what they expected; not always a good experience

personality wise people tend to think i am in a bad mood

example, i notice teeth, 'cause i'm short. but my tall friends tell
me they almost never notice teeth--they see eyes first and

clothes. ordinary clothes bore me. i have very long blond,
sometimes red hair."
""
""
"don't know, you'll have to tell me."
i'm tall??
"probably that i look pretty young. that's always been the case for
me and sometimes it can be a disadvantage. i think people
definitely take you more seriously when you look older. i guess it
also helps if you act responsibly too."
i shutter to think
""

maybe my smile? but i'm not too sure.
my eyes.
"how large my cranium is, and how much knowledge is in it. or my
laugh."
probably my tattoos.
my irreverence with respect to long held social mores.

enthusiasm! no matter what the endeavor, project, or something new,
i go at 100 percent with a maximal effort. physically, people say i
have a nice smile complimented with a broad physique. health and
fitness are extremely important to me."

heart for everyone."

holding."

""
my dimples
smile? eyes? have yet to send out a survey.
"i doubt it's the first thing, but i get lots of comments on my

i'm a good listener and i have a nice smile ;)
"im not sure, i hope its something good though!"
i have no idea...maybe my smile - that's one thing i often heard
"confidence in who i am as a person. i believe i can be positive to
some people. i am a pretty down to earth person in conversation. i
enjoy talking about more important things in life"
"not quite sure, honestly."
"probably my <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=blue+eyes"">blue
eyes</a>, <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=smile"">smile</a>,
that i usually have a flower in my hair, or my voice. i'm kind of
loud and easily excitable. i'm definitely more of a stand out in a
crowd rather than a blend in quietly type of personality.<br />
<br />
or really, it's more likely that i just tripped over something or
fell flat on my face or knocked something over and spilled my drink
all over the place. if <a class=""ilink"" href=

beyond the physical, people often say that they find me to be
empathetic, warm, straightforward, opinionated, positive, calm,
grounded, and easy going.<br />

sometimes it takes me a while to come out of my shell, so
occasionally people find me to be cool, standoffish or quiet. i

about that."
i smile a lot

hmm...probably my smile
"is my sunny personality! people often describe me as bright, happy,

people find out pretty quickly that i'm lacking in the filter
department. this often leads to awkward hilarity when i first get
to know people and breaks the ice.<br />

other traits people notice about me right away are that i'm
energetic and thoughtful. i like to ponder pretty much everything

match. that is until i start talking and then they notice my
outspoken personality always stating whats on my mind."
"the man i have tattooed on my right arm, senor salvador dali. he's
kind of popular with the strangers. as far as personality goes i
have been told that i am bubbly, goofy and weird. i am going to

* my dimples....<br />
* i wear my watch on my right hand but i'm not left handed<br />
* it's not very hard to make me laugh"

she first noticed my smile. i thought that seemed trite, but it's
the best answer i have."

nature."
i already look like a real lawyer.
my rat tail? my smile? my good vibe sensation?
"probably... my height at 6""3"

awkward."

"people tend to tell me that i'm obscenely tall. as if i haven't
already reached this conclusion on my own.<br />

then they tend to comment on my eyes (they shift from green to blue

bluff i may be trying to make. then depending on the day, my hair;
it's naturally curly but i love having it straight and long.<br />

after talking to me people normally notice my laugh, it's deep and
whole-hearted. i only laugh when something is truly funny."

things people notice. i used to work at a coffee shop in college

woman once stop mid-order when she noticed them to tell me how
breathtaking she thought they were, and on another occasion i had a
girl declare that my stare alone could probably bring her to
orgasm[!!!].<br />

also, when i stumble into the right lighting and my hair falls a
certain way people tend to think i bear a resemblance to the olsen

strangely accompanied by the sound of thunder and the cries of
babies. muahahaha!<br />

for you girls out there who are far from perfect (it could vary
from drinking problem, smoking cigs, drugs or very unhealthy diet
that can lead to heart disease or diabetes), let me give you some
advice on how to tell if a guy truely love you or he's just after
your physical appearance and pleasure.<br />
<br />
the guy who let you do whatever you want: he doesn't care about you
and don't look out for your best interest, he's after you for
pleasure.<br />
<br />
the guy who nag at you, treats you like his daughter when it comes
to bad habits you have, you would feel like he is as annoying as
your dad: he truely loves you, because he cares about your well
being and look out for your best interest, it takes alot of efforts
to try change you especially if you don't listen, it's very
stressful and emotionally depressing.<br />
<br />
people might not born bad, but if they are under drug and alcohol
influence, they can do scary things like these:<br />

how painfully awkward and shy i can be sometimes.<br />
how incredibly talkative, witty and (perhaps even) charming i am
when i'm motivated/drunk enough to talk to a girl i like."
i'm really easy to get along with.

living well!)"

third thing: they ask me if the tattoo is real (yes)<br />

eyes"".<br />
<br />
in other words, my eyes. they are fearless.<br />
<br />
i dress kinda funky too."
"quirky and playful, shy at first"
"my height for sure. i tend to always be the tallest of all my
friends. my smile comes a close second. i've been told on numerous
occasions that i'm never without a smile on my face."
my eyelashes or smile
"depends on who you ask...those who hate me will say my loud mouth,
those who love me will say my ability to pump people up and put
everything in a positive light."
""
"the first thing people notice about me... my eyes or my accent,
but<br />
they usually can't figure out exactly where it's from."
"i'm tall...especially when i'm with asian-am friends. i have a
classic/conservative dress sense: slacks for work, jeans for
weekends, and skirts for special occasions. in conversation, people
notice my quick wit, usually tied to some part of the dialog, or
the way i seem to have trivia for every occasion."
"my smile, friendliness or randomness"
eyes
"typically people notice my smile or my eyes. there is one person at
the toll plaza on the bay bridge that alternates complimenting me
on those two things. i guess i should just get a fastrak and be
done with it."
my hair and how young i look.
""
"obviously people immediately notice that i am tall! being 5ft 9in,
i tend to stand out even though i might not always like it, haha!"
"height, my beard and my swag."
"if i'm looking into the sunlight, they notice my multicolored eyes.
otherwise, generally people notice my energy. i can't help but get
a little over-excited when i am meeting new people.<br />
otherwise, i think people notice that i'm often wearing something
that says diving or stanford."

love to smile and i usually smile a lot, so no wonder its the first
thing people notice!"

people first notice."
i am usually smiling :)

it's infectious. :)"
"so according to this book on body language, apparently women have
much better peripheral vision than men. it's not that men look
more; it's that, because of our more direct gaze, we just get
caught more!<br />
<br />
except when you're on a bike. no time for discretion. more than a
few heads turn."
my smile!
to be honest? my boobs. a very close second would be my eyes...
"my well groomed beard and my long eye lashes. my smile fits
somewhere in there, too."
"wouldn't i be the person least able to answer this? shouldn't you
be asking someone who met me? if i had to guess, i'd probably say
people notice that it takes very little to get me to start talking,
about most anything. or my eyes, perhaps? they're rather blue. i'll
ask around and see what the consensus is, that'll be fun..."
"my (male) roommate calls it my ""beautiful angelic golden hair""."
my vibrant energy and mix-matched socks.
is my laugh. it's unique...
"my facial expressions, especially when they include smiles.<br />
<br />
i've also gotten progressively worse at small-talk. it's an atrophe
that i'm actively trying to fix. similarly, i can't flirt to save
my life, which isn't to say that i wouldn't like to."
my dog

i drink tea, not coffee."
i still can't figure this one out.

delicious and of course it has different meaning in my language."
my legs. especially when i wear my short running shorts. no joke.

"well as in looks, i'm asian, i wear glasses, i've got scars, i'm
tall and i'm chubby, so not your typical vietnamese girl that you
see."
it depends on the person!
"probably my hair. it's pretty long. or the headphones i have around
my neck at all times."
my laugh. people tell me it's quite distinctive.
my skin
"my eyes, and that i'm pretty easy-going"
"my glorious smile, that many say lights up a room :p"
my eyes
"that i look way too young to be a dudley, my big blue eyes and
sarcastic demeanor."
"hmm, my smile? nah, that's too cliche, so...how about my blunt
personality. i usually say what's on my mind, i've found it's a lot
easier to really get to know people when you don't have to worry
about filtering your words."
my curls and my girls.
my square jawline.
"people always notice my appearance first, especially when i am
outside of san francisco. even when i go out fully dressed and try
to ""pass"" as a woman, my outfits are a little outrageous. i'm
overly fond of pink things, for example, even if they clash with
the rest of my outfit. high heels and boots of all kinds are
another passion of mine, no matter how impractical. i have run
across busy intersections in heels before - in front of oncoming
traffic. and i really do mean high - 3 inches, 4 inches, even 5
inches or more. i don't own anything lower. i also have a fondness
for leather, regardless of the weather. it's raining? i don't care,
umbrellas will fix it. 80 degrees outside? i don't care, i'd rather
sweat than look boring.<br />
<br />
to top it off, i have hair that is almost down to my waist. even in
san francisco, you just don't see that too often, especially on
males. all of this combines to make for a pretty distinctive
profile. i'm someone that sticks out of the crowd. people always
stare at me and give me a wide berth...whether they are merely
curious or downright disapproving, i don't know, but in any case i
guess i intimidate them."
"my height and my salt &amp; pepper hair, which is mostly silver at
the sides - random people compliment it all the time! a reoccurring
theme at parties is that someone will think i look like george
clooney.."
maybe my first okcupid date can help me out with this one??
"my smile<br />
my twinklie eyes<br />
my cute feet"
""
"my laugh. i've been told that it sounds deep and slightly evil. i'm
told when i really laugh that it's contagious."
my tight jeans.
"my hair is super blond. i like to think of it as a superpower that
makes me easy to spot in crowds."
"physically, my height &amp; eyes. when we speak, how mellow &amp;
nice i am."
"i don't know, i've never been them, but if i had to take a guess,
i'd imagine it's handsomeness."
"whether they have met me before<br />
or not"
""
"if my hair is freshly cut into a new hairstyle, they first notice
that and how much better i look because of it.<br />
next people realize that i am not as thin as i may look in my pics.
i use current pics, but i also know how to angle myself in pics to
look much better. pics are what we want to be, not who we are. we
want to be and look better than we are, who we are inside mixed
with outside defines all that into something that is ever emerging.
take note here.<br />
lastly, people notice my blue eyes and then go, ""oh ooohh blue eyes
and blonde hair.."" followed by one of the many hitler jokes i've
probably heard in my lifetime. it's sometimes funny, sometimes very
uncomfortable."
"my gregarious personality and my smile :) i'll charm your pants
off."
"my lazy eye, man hands, and big feet."
"prolly how young i look, and my hair. i swear i'm going to get
carded till i'm 40."
"i'm extremely tall. so let me stop you there... no, i am not a
basketball or volleyball player. no, i am not currently a model.
no, i will not grab that off the top shelf for you. yes, they do go
all the way up. no, it doesn't take a long time to shave them. the
weather up here is just fine."

i'm really tall.

the fact that i look asian (but am not)

"did i mention i'm blunt? i think one of the first things people
notice about me is that i move past the small talk. i say what i
mean and i mean what i say. sometimes i'm shy; sometimes i'm told i
come on too strong."
my eyes
""
probably the big bunny ears i decided to wear out that day.
""
"the first thing peope usually notice about me is that i am tall for
a grrl. i think the next thing they notice is my lazy eye (joke!
joke! no lazy eye!). my dreadlocks are quite long, so people
comment on those all the time. i also get, ""you have a beautiful
smile,"" but that may just be a pick up line..."
"see, am i really the best person to ask this of? how the hell am i
supposed to know what other people first notice about me?! i don't
know. though, i guess it'd be entirely fair to say that you'd have
to be helen keller dead in a box not to notice my freak flag or the
unfettering with which it flies."

that someone is tall, we know already!!!! that statement has
baffled me my entire life - why mention to someone they are tall?
do you not think that i am not aware of this already?<br />
<br />
i do also come across as very friendly, it must be my smile. walk
around with me, i guarantee someone will strike up a random
conversation with me, and yes, i really do converse back. no reason
not to be friendly :)"

70s yelled out at me ""cute boots"" the other day."

probably notice that instead of shaking hands with people i go
straight for the hugging!!!!"

myself are the friends who've stuck around when things just
couldn't get worse.<br />

ease, that even though i have a tendency to use big words my sense

5. i have a love of messenger bags and low top converse sneakers."
my smile
my hair...i've been told my hair looks blue it's so black
petite lady with bangs for days.
is a smile and a hand shake...
my eyes....maybe ;)
funnily serious.
"i'm tall, my hair is red, and i'm cleverly disguised as a
responsible adult. i have a gentle, seemingly quiet presence."
would probably be my smile but my laugh would be a close runner-up!
""
"everyone thinks i'm tall...but i'm only 6'1"", but fo some reason
people comment on how tall i am....being 6'1"" does make me a god
cuddler for those hot short guys out there.<br />
eyes would be the next thing guys notice. the actually change
color. sometime light brown othertimes greeninsh or hazel. on the
good side they don't glow bright red anymore. the exorcisim took
care of that !"
"my white belt if i'm wearing it.<br />
otherwise my curly hair or blue eyes."
you tell me... probably my accent i'd have thought.
"i'm allowed to talk about fight club.<br />
<br />
i have this weird thing where i'm pretty reserved until i get to
know you/realize i'm not intimidated by you/get drunk and then i
open up. a lot.<br />
<br />
comments on my hair, if it's big, aren't uncommon either."
"lips nose hair or...? well i guess it depends who you ask.<br />
i'm often told i'm sweet, tolerant and an ""interesting fellow."""
"um... i don't really know! i guess it depends on the individual.
people usually say that i look younger than i really am."
i am 6'4'' so i am really tall for an asian guy
is that i look about 5 years younger than i am.
my laugh
""
"smiles and smirks.<br />
shyness which gives way to cynicism which gives way to agreeable
sincerity."
deep voice probably
my spectacles.
""
my wit. my charm. my good looks.
"they should remove this question - seriously, does anyone like
answering it? maybe, if we meet, you can tell me what you noticed
about me and i'll tell you what i noticed about you."
"i think it's my hair. it's quite unwieldy and i don't do enough to
tame it."
""
i'm not sure; you tell me!
my smile.
"probably my crazy-person laugh. rarely is there not a smile on my
face and a chuckle just around the corner."
""
""
"i am big..tall,muscular,smile..you tell me."
""
honestly i have no idea. probably my smile.
you tell me!
is my sarcasm/ sense of humor hehe ;)
most people usually notice my eyes and height.
"my vibrance<br />
<br />
somedays: my excessive use of pink"
"i have always found this an odd question but what i imagine what
people first notice is that i seem a bit reserved, especially in a
group. i am not an extrovert but i enjoy good conversation, meeting
people and new experiences. i just tend to observe and take in a
situation before i jump in head first. or maybe when they first see
me they think wow that is a bright yellow purse"
"i once was told that there was something otherworldy about me. lips
and eyes tend to be remarked on i suppose.."
"my half-smile, sometimes it flares up on me and goes full smile but
only when i'm happy."
"my sense of humor, or how puppy dog like i can be."
my smile. i really do smile a lot.

"i'm tall, but the shortest in my family... my accent... my dimples,
my steely blue eyes (yes, they're made of solid steel)... :-p"
""
"smile, energy, eyes, easy going nature"
"i'm enthusiastic and adventurous, and i think that comes across
pretty quickly. that said, people probably notice my eyes first."
""
"my presence....energy, what ever you want to call it."
"i tend to intimidate people, i have had a handful of people tell me
when they first laid eyes on me they thought i would be stuck up,
but turns out i'm just a very mellow person."
"smile<br />
friendliness"
i am freaking big!
"i don't know...i rarely ask people what they notice about me upon
first meeting them. that kind of makes a weird first impression."
my smile
that i'm tall. that i'm a badass. a very shy badass.
my arms
"that i wear my sunglasses at night.<br />
<br />
just kidding. people notice how white my legs are. i can't help how
very, very white i am. it's either white or white with freckles."
my smile :)
"i get told at least once a day that i look like harry potter, or
daniel radcliffe..."
""
"that my foot is often in my mouth.<br />
<br />
my natural color contrast."
""
""
"i'd like to think that it's my wit and charm, but really its the
height. always the height."
"most people comment on my eyes. they are an uncommon shade of green
and seem to change colors depending on my mood and what i'm
wearing.<br />
<br />
if i'm wearing a tank top people will comment on my tattoo which is
on my right shoulder blade."
""
my pug. he's irresistibly charming.
"eyes, smile, ass?"
"sweetness, warm and empathic"
"my height, or maybe its the support staff of acrobatic albino
pygmies i have follow me around.<br />
<br />
i lied, i don't actually have a support staff, so i'll stick with
my height then (or maybe my devilishly good looks)<br />
<br />
it's happenning more and more often, but appearantly my facial
expressions are will ferrell-esque. take it as you will, but shit,
the guy is funny and he's really not that bad looking, though i
don't see the resemblance at all"
"probably something insignificant, but hopefully something
meaningful."
i'm a happy person.
"my chucks. i know its weird, since there's probably a million
people who wear the exact same pair of shoes, but it's amazing how
often i hear about them."
loud
"i laugh a lot and am always smiling! and i'm pretty tall for a
girl. but not freakishly tall. ;)"
""
i guess my smile accompanied with my joyful personality
""
"well, two friends of mine were trying to figure out if they were
talking about the same person and one said to the other, ""is she
short, curly hair, with delicate hands?""<br />
<br />
and then they knew."
"my love of milksteak, magnets and ghouls."
my smile!
that i exist.

my smile
that im always on my bike.
""
my prominent (or big) nose or my lips.
my awesomeness.
...that i'm tall and i have a nice smile.
"according to my friends.... people notice my sense of humor and
sarcasm."
"that i am tall, that i have bad taste in nail polish and that i can
be a little bit shy at first."
"my friend peter tells me that my eyes are and i quote ""ginormous""
so maybe that is something others quite frequently notice
first.<br />
<br />
i think this question is quite subjective."
"are my eyes, crazy and curly hair (not typically asian poker
straight) and intelligence"
i laugh a lot
"my smile, i've been told!"
"british accent, smart, fast dry wit."
beside my french accent.... yours to discover!
i smile a lot.
dark hair and eyes.
my smile
my smile and laugh
"is my height. i am 6', no lie! next would probably be my sense of
humor. dry, witty, and completely sarcastic."
you'd have to ask them.
my height.
"whatever i am thinking...i'm terrible at hiding what i'm feeling.
i'm an open book"
"you know when you go to a show and some tall guy stands in front of
you? this is your chance to be the girl standing in front of him
instead."
"the aura of awesomeness surrounding me is quite noticeable. am i a
man or am i a muppet? if i'm a muppet then i'm a very manly
muppet.<br />
<br />
actually, scratch that, the first thing they notice is that i'm
usually making some ridiculous self-aggrandizing statement. i'm a
self-assured nerd who enjoys poking fun at himself and the
absurdity of life in general.<br />
<br />
i am not that difficult to spot in a crowd. unlike most men i
actually enjoy shopping and i dress to impress on a daily basis.
i'll also admit to owning too many clothes as a result of my mother
being in the fashion industry (thanks, mom, love ya').<br />
<br />
some friends have noted that i look like a russian cross of johnny
depp in blow and leonardo dicaprio in the beach with the
personality of joseph gordon-levitt or neil patrick harris. they
would often describe me as being very zen or contemplative. there
are very few things that would make me panic or lose face and i
seem to have a calming effect on most people."
big smile.
"baseball cap, height."
blue eyes?
""
i talk fast and think faster.
""
"my eyes and my sense of humor. it can be kind of dark. i also tend
to like off the wall things. think mel brooks movie humor meets
family guy. i love me some spaceballs."
i'm probably laughing or smiling. or i'm being shy.
"i'm a smart-ass (not meant to be clever in light of the the
previous answer)."
how outgoing i am
""
"my optimism about life and experiences, this is our existence and
we are responsible for how we choose to look at it."

- that my fly is down
"hats. men should wear hats, and i do. always."
you tell me?
the beard i've been sporting.
my eyes. people always ask if they are color contacts- they're not!
"face followed by whatever followed by wild enthusiasm for anything
that you're wildly enthusiastic about."
"my dentist says i have lovely teeth, but i'm guessing most people
notice that i'm pretty tall and texan."
"most likely my height, i've got some respectable altitude."
i've got a great smile and a great laugh.
"i usually blend in pretty well. (i'm not currently in an
outrageous-hairdo phase.)<br />
<br />
but people seem to get really excited about minor acts of
cross-dressing, and go out of their way to say, ""i really like your
scarf/eye-liner/panties."""
""
"tall, probably needs a haircut and/or shave. i can look smug or
grouchy for no particular reason. these expressions usually have
nothing to do with how i am actually feeling.<br />

dressed/undressed)"
"him: my eyes, then my laugh<br />
her: i'm quick to smile.."
"i have a lot of energy and like to joke around. i like to be
creative and goof-off. i like to talk about everything and
understand how things work...stuff like that."
""
"after my height and my race, its probably that i'm funny. without
being a dick about it."
"i have a deep voice, which i don't notice, until i hear myself in a
voice mail or something like that. i'm not aggressive and very
approachable."
"depends on the day i suppose. a lot of people notice my bangs for
some reason"
i have a serious problem with smiling...as in i never stop.
"my facial hair, i've had a beard for close to 7 years.<br />
i'm doing this one thing where i'm growing my mustache out over my
beard. going for that 19th century river boat gambler look."
"my laugh<br />
also my hair, it tends to get a bit out of control as the night
wears on..."
i'm not sure; ask them.
"is my open personality and willingness to see and learn things i
know nothing about"
i'm told i've got nice eyes.
"you gotta tell me that :p may be that i am very competitive and
physically.. my height!"
""
that i'm relaxed and comfortable.
""
"that i'm listening to them. i pride myself on avoiding awkwardness
with strangers by asking about what they're into. more often than
not, we'll find something in common. it's a small small world out
there."
"the first thing people notice about me is my smile and my easy way
of making people feel confortable."
my skills/z
""
"i have dimples. also, i apparently have nice eyes."
"not too sure. i suppose i don't spend much time thinking about how
other people perceive me. if i were to guess, it'd be a) my eyes b)
my sarcasm c) my sexual energy. ok, maybe not the last one.<br />
<br />
if i'm with friends, i think people see me as loud and outgoing and
funny. at least i think i'm funny. but if i'm meeting new people at
a party or networking function, i may seem like an uninterested
asshole. but really, i'm just an introvert who's not as comfortable
in those situations."
i change subjects often :)
sad lack of color coordination/ physical coordination.

tattoo."
im pretty tall.

minnesota vikings shirt, it's probably that."
my positive optimistic personality.
sense of humor
""
"i want to say smile. but nope, it's probably my height. if it's not
my height, then it's my attire. and if it's not my shoes, then they
are wondering what type of asian i am. and while their postulating,
i'm thinking what to devour next. tacos, curry, ramen? ah, these
life decisions. hmm...maybe pizza. i'm addicted to anchovies
lately."
""
"my eyes, my chest, my smile, my abs"
""
my eyes?
obviously my dashing good looks!!
my glasses and the hat i wear most days everyday.
my eyelashes
"i have no idea. one friend says that i'm very sure of what i know,
but very upfront about what i don't."
"i'm kinda tall - 6'4"" pre-shoes. trans-pacific flights = not always
so fun. hard-to-reach ingredients at the back of the top kitchen
shelf = no problem!"

or me tripping over something. gracefully."
i've got exceptionally long legs and dangerous karate moves.
i have a slight accent.

"that i look better in person. i hate taking pics and my niece
recently told me to write ""must see in person"" on my profile. i
think that was a nice way of saying that i am not photogenic. :("
"an incessant desire to accomplish more, a decent smile and a warm
conversationalist. also my height."
"my glasses? that i like color? my bags?<br />
<br />
i once went on a weekend trip to glasgow and my friend teased me
saying that i should bring different shoes, glasses, and bags for
each day. just for fun i did."
"hmm, i guess you can tell me on this one. i don't really recall the
first time i noticed myself."
"my striking good looks, which sometimes takes people by surprise if
they're not ready for it.<br />
people also notice that i have piercing blue eyes that you can swim
laps in. and that i'm modest."
i'm sarcastic.
my eyes

but people tell me that i look a lot younger than i am.<br />

i've also been told i have a pretty nice beard."

""
"i get people telling me all the time that i have a very friendly,
genuine, and pretty smile.<br />
<br />
my tattoos. they're subtle but in noticeable places. like my
neck.<br />
<br />
often, i get told i'm a good dancer. i'm told that i'm prettier
than my pictures, which is always nice to hear. i'm a tall girl,
and i'd say i'm a bit of a chubby kid.<br />
<br />
sometimes, i come across as shy in group settings. but its more
that i'm just a little reserved. i'm much better one-on-one."
?
"it used to be my big beard which i have recently excised, and i'm
still dealing with the postpartum loss."
"i am almost always overdressed for every occasion. especially
casual ones. (sf guys take note- no teeshirts on first
dates.)<br />
<br />
i've been told that i seem ""mysterious."" whatever. someone
suggested ""detached,"" which i feel is a good word. if you're very
observant, you might notice the way i scurry behind friends or run
away when being introduced to people. it's not that i don't like
you, i promise. if i didn't want to meet people, i wouldn't have a
profile here, ne c'est pas?"
my confidence and my eyes

adorable.

too much."
there's something different about that guy...

the jetpack or my eyes. depends on how fast i'm going.

bhaaaaah."

umm... my smile, my laugh, my *zen* nature - ha! that i'm friendly
and approachable? strangers seem to notice that; sometimes,
strangers i'm not so fired up to talk with. but i talk to them
anyway. i'm a solid, no bullshit kinda person with a sense of
humor."

look like ross from friends."

i have no idea... i'm so out of the loop...
raised eyebrow and smile
i am pretty friendly so i think people remember that about me.
"i really don't know, may be you could tell me :)"
"i was going to say ""green eyes"". but how about something less
immediately obvious: people often tell me they feel like they've
known me for much longer than us just meeting. i think it's because
when i like you, i'm warm, genuine and make you feel comfortable."
my sincerity.

is. she is one of the guys but also all the girls best friend. a
complete package. you will notice her smile, her laugh, her heart

smile and positive attitude
"i'm tall and friendly. i am generally very excited to meet new
people with a smile."
"i love trying out new things. i'm extremely adventurous and don't
mind checking out the unknown because it typically leads to a great
time. word of mouth is one of my favorite ways to find out about
places or experiences to have."
"my eyes. apparently they are shiny. the irises are 3 different
colors."
"i don't really know, but i hope it's not some major flaw that i've
completely overlooked, and everyone is too polite to say anything.

that kind of brutal honesty..."

easily. i am not sure why that is."
you tell me.

they don't...because i sneak up behind them
"people tell me my eyes disappear when i smile. then they usually
ask if i'm asian. i'm not, i'm just big cheeked!"
i have never asked. once i conduct a survey i will get back to you.
"i put them at ease and they start telling me stuff... i listen to
and forget about other's secrets. people think they have met me
before, but can't remember which life it was...apparently."

put into it. well, now that i think about it, people may notice my
diamond encrusted fangs, my broad shoulders, my height, my smile,
my black finger nail polish, my gaze, my presence or my laughter."
my eyes and dimples =)
my smile and sarcastic sense of humor.
i'm funny
my smile and laughter
i do my own thing.
"big eyes, tall and lanky, dark skin. kind of cautious, wary, almost
cat-like even. dunh, dunh, duh."

to resemble someone they know. i just have one of those faces i
guess. recent look-a-like i get is mac from always sunny in
philadelphia."

english accent and well mannered and have an identical twin."

i'll take that compliment! besides that, i do get comments about my
eyes. so let's say eyes. eyes is my final answer."
probably my smile.
i'm always smiling.

"i don't know if it's the first thing, but i have been told i have a
distinctive (though not distinctively annoying) laugh."
"here, it seems to be my accent..."

disarmingly odd. if i do say so myself."

my blue eyes."

i also get that i look like gogo yubari from kill bill often."

i do look pretty good in a short skirt, but it's not like i wear

my slender body. how plain and straight laced that i appear on the
outside, that is not really how i am when you get to know me..."
i have gigantic eyes for being asian.

away in pictures because of it (either that or i fully embrace it).
sometimes people tell me they never notice it. they are liars, i
bet."

my sudden presence.

smart, possibly smarter than i am (her exact words)<br />
witty<br />
has a real passion (i think she meant for life or my job, but i am
not sure)<br />
full disclosure: she also said there was no real spark between us

is no other way."

that is good or not is hard to say."

curly and has a blonde patch in it ;p"

it's all good by me."
i'm real and people recognize that in me
"my accent, for sure. i don't think is horrible but its definitely
there.<br />

i can be perceived as a shy person, because when i don't know
someone very much, i like to listen first instead of bombarding
them with questions.<br />

of hair if i wanted to) but these days i like it like that.<br />

befuddled compliments on it."

my smile.
"my sketchbook. i typically draw whenever i have some down time,
which is odd considering how much of my job involves drawing -

good conversation starter on the bus, often with people i don't
wish to talk to but beggars can't be choosers i suppose."

first impressions. but once i find some common ground i'm pretty

company of another human who likes them....just likes them for

actually."

my clear blue eyes, my promptness, and my quick witted humor.

i smile a lot and like to make others smile.

attention then i'd like them to :/. maybe it's the velcro? lol."
"nice glasses, bad hair"
is my accent. and i am not very proud of it.
"who knows? probably my hair. although people mention my laugh all
the time. these days, however, it's my pimp stick (cane). i was hit
by a car in january and my bones are still healing. don't worry
though, no pity party needed, i'll be fine eventually. :)"

tentacles. i almost wrote testicles. i think my aura does have
testicles."
"well, since people yell ""hey, jesus!' at me from across the street
on a daily basis, i have to go with my hair. i also look like a
viking, which makes sense, given that i am. as for the
non-physical, i know that people (especially americans) are usually
intrigued by the fact that i easily break into other languages
where necessary/convenient, or when i am pretending to be a spy.
the jordanians that run my neighborhood 7/11 think i am in the fbi.
sitting on a bus and being surrounded by a chorus of conversations
is heaven for me, and being multilingual is a key part to my brain.

me at all. i try to be invisible. ;)"

brown eyes of course!"
let me know what you notice and maybe i'll add it here.

curious, ask good questions, and i'm friendly, dependable and
trustworthy."

my smile and eyes.
i tend to smile way too much.
probably the way i'm dressed or my face/hair
that i have nice hair...and it changes often

my glasses.<br />
my finger tattoos."
"my eyes, smile, and sass."
"my eyes and my trustee dog jack jack. he's always by my side.
protecting and loving. i posted a picture of him but okcupid
deleted :-( and last but not least, my knitting needle and yarn.
i'm always knitting. it keeps me occupied. knit knit knit."
"is my smile. especially since i love to laugh. also, some people
don't understand my sense of humor and find me offensive at first.
once they better understand that i'm generally a nice person who
just loves cracking sarcastic jokes, most people learn to love me.

i'm way too happy. that i have eyes. two of them.

likely that i didn't know? <em>holy shit! i absolutely did not know

by the by, that is probably not going to happen.<br />

sometimes people think i'm funny. mostly, i think it's the
tits.<br />

it occurs to me that this section makes me sound like some crazy
nudist. do not be alarmed, this is the opposite of truth. i am
sometimes topless. (in this case, i was topless at the dyke march,
which is a <em>totally reasonable and wholesome</em> place to be
topless. except that then you end up at pink saturday, and you're
still topless, and now random jackass guys are coming up and
tweaking your nipples. who goes to pink saturday to tweak random
girls' nipples? srsly, dude, it's pride, go find a cock to suck and
leave my tits alone. that's how it works.)"

obsessed with the things i'm passionate about, and i love to talk
about them with people who don't mind listening and/or debating

good! just a subtle detail that makes you who you are, and will

i'm not jewish, i'm just a fan. it's been an interesting
experience, to wear something so obvious and which is thought to be
deeply meaningful. people treat me differently than before, and
it's been a fascinating experiment in that kind of thing.
perception and treatment. as for religion and belief, no, it's not
about that. think of all the non-rastafarians with dreadlocks.
it'll be trendy soon, i'm sure.<br />

beyond that? i suppose my bright <a class=""ilink"" href=

that i've started speaking to them apparently with no obvious
reason or invitation. frequently when i'm wandering around the
city, i'm with my daughter and people notice her. she also just
starts talking to people whenever she feels the urge.<br />
<br />
that's another story, about perception and treatment. women aren't
casual about making eye contact with men in public, mainly because
of a plethora of experiences where asshole guys have assumed that
simple eye contact meant ""please follow me home"" or ""yes, i do
totally want to fuck you, please be rude to me!"" that all changes
when you're a papa walking around with a baby. it was like being
reborn. i went from being a threat to being trustworthy and safe to
approach and even talk to, both based on superficial attributes. a
lot of the gay boys in my neighborhood started paying less
attention to me as well."

"when i was an undergrad on my final year i was walking down the
street, bundled up against the thawing cold in my only stylish
coat, inevitably to become my only well worn and thoroughly lived
in. it was another day, another walk to perhaps class or the corner
store for some eggs for dinner, or perhaps dinner itself in one of
the cheap burrito or pizza places that littered the sides of
thayer. bundled in with my scarf snugly (and also stylishly) around
my neck and my black striped fedora on my head, i saw a young
blonde walking towards me. i thought i saw her looking forward but
then as i blinked her eyes were firmly planted on the ground, as if
to make sure those steps in front of her really existed, as if they
may give way into quicksand or some snow-covered hole in the
ground. my sure steps and sense of direction were assured,
confident, comfortable, and hers seemed unsure, inward, or perhaps
just a little chilled from the providence cold. it was going to be
a regular passing by of two people at the end of winter and
beginning of spring (albeit with perhaps a quick but hopefully
unnoticeable glance from me) when suddenly she looked up at me and
met my eyes (from my probably less than unnoticeable glance).<br />
<br />
""i like your hat"" she whispered shyly before passing me by with a
heartwarming smile.<br />
<br />
my sense of adventure and sense of modesty then battled each other
for a full 5 seconds before the former came out on top, telling me
it was probably a good idea to ask her for her number or some tea,
but at that point she was already a good 20 feet behind me, too far
away for me to run up to her and ask in any graceful or
unembarrassed way.<br />

i still wear that hat."

well. wow - now that he's closer he actually seems to be graying,
maybe he doesn't mean well after all. i'm just gonna pretend i'm on

subjective, so shouldn't really matter what others notice."

the east coast pace of my speech.
"my loud laughter and friendly attitude. i am still deciding if
these are good or bad things to point out when making a first
impression."
"within a few minutes they realize that they're confused by my
accent. the reason is that i learned how to speak english in
england, but only lived there for 5 years, followed by america (ca
&amp; ny) for 9 years, and before all that i lived in denmark,
france, switzerland, and israel for a few years each."

"hmm. im not sure~<br />
but, what i do know is.. i'm kind of an odd one, and i like to
concentrate on the feeling of someone rather than what they look
like, and if i had to choose, one of the first things i would
notice is peoples posture... it says a lot about a person. someone
that stands up strait, and looks forward not down says confident. a
person who slouches and hangs their head low says, uncomfortable..
and perhaps it gives a vibe that they are unapproachable and
unfriendly. i am not suggesting that this is true all of the
time-just that it is the first impression, and i believe that a
person that always carries a smile-carries their most precious
accessory. smiles as well as a frown are contagious~<br />
so how about you, whats the first thing you notice about me??"
my aura and my aligned chakras i don't know what that means.
"my blue eyes.<br />

most definitely my laugh
my long curly hair and smile.
"i don't know. if you feel like helping me out with this i'd love
some input."
"i'm pretty laid back and even keeled at most times, which most
people usually pick up right off the bat.<br />

also...origins are very hard to pin down; having dark hair and a
scruffy face can make you pass for being from many parts of this
world, apparently."
"i'm outgoing and overly confident. after people get to know me
better they realize i'm very aware of the thoughts and opinions of
those around and i do my best to help anyone out.<br />
<br />
i love cars. i know a good deal about them and have very strong
opinions about each brand. i try not to, but i definitely judge
people based on what they drive.<br />
<br />
other than that i smile, laugh a whole bunch, and make terribly
inappropriate jokes (comes with living in a frat)."

make fun of my self :)"
i'm probably taller than them
my bright blue eyes and striking good looks?
my hair its luscious..haha
"that i once held a guinness world record (it's in the 2007 book).
alright, no one notices that, but i had to sneak that factoid in
here some how."

accent which i hear is sexy... but i will not be the one to tell..."

but hey, this is what the people say :-))"

"for better or worse, i tend to be extremely precise in the way that
i talk and communicate - not that i'm like a robot, but i often
take a second or two to think things over before i speak.<br />
<br />
i've been told that i'm a fairly swanky dresser nowadays - although
this was not always the case.<br />

nobody stares at me, so i assume that i'm not horribly physically
disfigured in any way. :)"
my smile and my big brown eyes.
how unique i am. crazy unique.
"my mouth! and not in any gross way, mind you. i just have nice lips
and straight, white teeth [most of the time. though i do have a
horrible coffee habit!]."
my smile?
"i usually speak slowly in face-to-face conversation, and i often
try to speak nearly as carefully as i would write. i'm capable of
speaking quickly, but i don't do it all the time, so people often
call me ""deliberate"". i have a strong (not eidetic) associative
memory and fairly eclectic cultural interests. i often prefer
long-form communications like long conversations or long letters or
e-mails, but i don't usually approach people whom i don't already
know to chat with them.<br />

some people find me eccentric because i have some geeky interests,
like <a class=""ilink"" href=

initially seem like a pythagorean because of my <a class=""ilink""

grammatical features came from, which is to say amateur <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=historical+linguistics"">historical
linguistics</a>). i'm likely to randomly mention facts about
language to people, tell them about etymologies, or ask them
questions about languages they speak. (and i can argue why
splitting the infinitive ""to randomly mention"" in the previous
sentence is not wrong.)"

"hmmm...i dunno. i'll have to start asking people. probably that
i'll just chat with random strangers."
"my size (pretty large dude, specially for a brown guy). and my
smile. i have a goofy crooked smile and i tend to smile a lot, i'm
a pretty easy-going guy and just enjoy people in general. oh, and

i'm passionate about or some common ground ... small talk is not

value on what we do and not enough on what our interests are. the
latter defines you more than the former, even if you spend more

no, but seriously. we're brothers, so that's sometimes totally

is also a world in which i get kicked out of ikea and arrested.

"you will think that i'm a sweet, quiet, demure girl who obeys my
mother and goes to church.<br />

even after i tell you a couple of life stories and have a nice
cocktail and mention that i'm an atheist, you will still probably
think this.<br />

"i am different, unique. i have strong opinions but am softspoken. i
believe we were given two ears and one mouth for a reason. there is
not a crisis in the history of mankind that was solved, resolved,
stopped, whatever by lack of communication. communication is
something i pride myself in, i like to think that i am an excellent
communicator &amp; i will listen to just about any viewpoint,
sometimes just out of fairness. but just because we're talking,
doesn't necessarily mean we're friends. if i have an opposing
viewpoint, i will express it."

things and genuinely interested in people."

i don't know? why don't you tell me.
my height and sugar addiction.
my wry smile and what may be under it.
""
my height. people usually look down to see if i'm wearing heels : )
my eyes or my hair (it's big)
"how should i know? probably that i am tall and broad shouldered and
have a huge smile.<br />
people say, ""you have the ability to speak to anyone"""
"i'm shy-ish, loud-ish, funny-ish, thoughtful-ish, quirky-ish,
grounded-ish, calm-ish, zany-ish, brainy-ish, absentminded-ish,
confident-ish, awkward-ish. i have green eyes (well, they're
green-ish)."
"that i look way younger than my age - and, i suspect (at times),
that i don't act like it as well...<br />
<br />
but that could either be a good thing or a bad thing...depending on
the circumstances."
"my eyes, my lisp, my directness"
"the hair<br />
the eyes<br />
the magic"
""
i'm tall. i have a weird name.

maybe my lips? hopefully my smile.
""
""
"my eyes, smile and confidence."
""
my hair and smile
you tell me.
"my eyes are three different colors. actually they aren't but
everyone has an opinion about what color they are. what do you
think? my positive energy. i am a cheerleader for my students, my
friends, the giants, my family, the hallway decorating competition,
the dinner i am cooking, the t.v. show i am watching, the cars
driving by....get it?"
"are my blue eyes, hair, and charming good looks?"
"i would say my sterling wit, but really, it's my boobies."
my eyes and smile.
"my voice is unusually deep for my body. pretty much 4 out of 5
people comment on that. i get told i should be on the radio. after
that i would guess my eyes. they're blue.<br />
<br />
immediate reaction is that people can tell i'm fun loving and bring
good energy to almost every situation i find myself. i think my
friends would acknowledge that i'm a good person with good energy.
i don't buy into this idea that i can be ""8% enemy"" with someone
i've never met. it's not my nature. you won't notice ""enemy""
if/when you meet me."
"if i had to guess, i would say my hair."
"my curly hair. although... a fair number of homeless people have
commented on my smile."
"my ""light up a room"" smile!"
""

"my height, 6'4.<br />
my legs.<br />
my personality"

"i'm not sure... my smile? i notice that i can get others to smile
by smiling at them. i'm told that i'm cute. oddly, most people
don't seem to notice my deformities on a conscious level. if i'm
not wearing much clothing, people do notice my scars. (i attend
burning man events. there are plenty of opportunities for people to
see me scantily clad, or unclad.)<br />
<br />
i've posted a nice picture of me on a beach, that shows my arms
pretty well."
tornado in a suit jacket.
goofball.
"on a physical level people just notice my size. i am a tall and big
guy. not linebacker big but for sure i have a physical presence
about me."
""
my smile and youthful appearance
"how uncomfortable i seemingly look when i'm using my harness of
live spider-monkeys to get me up and down the stairs. i assure you,
i'm not uncomfortable at all; feels almost like a second skin."
""
they may hear my french accent or my laugh.
my dashing personality and i am an awesome conversationalist??
my upper body and my eyes.
my eyes.
"razor-sharp wit (as long as it's a relatively dull razor), and
electric blue glasses."
"my hair, height/legs, eyes, smile"
"i'm 24 but don't look like it at all. at least i'll still be the
young looking one in a decade or two, suckers."
"my blue eyes, especially if it's sunny out."
""
my new glasses...
zen-like. sleepy-eyed.
"unsolicited:<br />
a waitress complemented me on my eyes.<br />
<br />
solicited:<br />
i polled a random sampling of my friends, and they pretty much all
agreed that i was awesome."
""
my curls? my glasses?
my sexy eyelashes.
"well, that depends on the person. i'd say in general, it's the
curly red hair. for guys in a bar, it's probably something a little
curvier. ;)"
"outgoing, polite, attentive, smiling eyes and mouth...."
i'm tall!
my good natured sense of humor and laugh gets a lot of compliments.
"i'm don't think about that, but i believe my smile could be one
thing they notice.."
"that i'm probably asking them for directions, drooling on myself,
or acting slightly retarded."
"they may think i am a shy person, if you get to know me better you
will found out am not."
""
"probably my ethnicity- i'm a half japanese girl. other than that,
the fact that i'm pretty happy and smiley. when i'm getting around
town, people notice my sweet ride- a 2009 ruckus scooter."
"i have no idea. you'd have to ask ""the people"". people comment on
my smile and my hair most often but that may not be the first thing
they notice about me."
"dark skin, blue eyes, crazy demeanor."
""
"youthful appearance. ambiguous ethnic origin. average-to-awful
fashion sense."
""
"rugged goods looks and quiet charm. or was it quiet good looks and
rugged charm? maybe neither, i have no idea."
i laugh like a champion race horse. fast and devastating.
the smell of sex panther.
""
my sense of humor
"i don't know. i'm not other people.<br />
<br />
i'd like to say that people notice my sharp intellect and other
admirable qualities. unfortunately, most of my better qualities are
not quickly conveyed so one would have to spend some time with me
to uncover the few gems i have to offer.<br />
<br />
it is most likely however, that the first thing people notice is
that i talk a whole lot. thankfully, i can be still and silent in
good company without needing to fill up the calm with nervous
chatter.<br />
<br />
i suspect if i were to ask my close friends that they'd say the
first thing they noticed about me was that i appeared to be
afflicted with severe symptoms of advanced bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (variant creutzfeldt-jakob for those unfamiliar with
the source cause).<br />
<br />
a funny thing happened to me back around may 2008 and at curiously
repeating intervals to present. i have had people observe that i
talk quickly and ask in short order if i had ever taken
stimulants/meth. the bad news? i have never taken stimulants,
methamphetamine, nor do i consume energy drinks or drink coffee (i
like peppermint tea). i'm just a very enthusiastic
conversationalist. i know people who will make the extra effort to
keep me from inadvertently becoming caffienated or stimulant
altered given what they already experience of my high-output
personality.<br />
<br />
of course, i've also been described as pathologically high spirited
but how accurate could that possibly be?<br />
<br />
wait!!<br />
<br />
don't answer that!!<br />
<br />
i've been complimented on my eyes from time to time.<br />
<br />
oh, and i seem to be universally envied by women for my long
eyelashes (it's an arabic trait)."
"i think the first thing people notice about me is my looks. after
that, they notice my personality. i am outgoing and vivacious at
times, and serious and quiet in other instances. it's all good,
though! thirdly, i think people notice my intelligence."
"my wild curly hair; my energy; my friendliness; my self-confidence;
my golden eyes"

"height, eyes, how sarcastic i am but fun;)..."
"my smile, or on a rare warm day in sf, my calves."
where are you from&gt;
"not sure, gonna ask joe and sally, they should know."
"no clue!?! i'm too busy enjoying my 20's to even take a second to
notice how others view me."

that i have no talent nor respect for punctuation and arrogant
bullies...oh: and that i have a sense of, humor,"

"my smile, energy, intelligence, easy-going nature, open-mindedness
and directness."
you would have to ask them.
"my smile, warmth and approachability<br />

children, animals, and people in need of directions flock to me. i
just spent a month traveling and people in london, munich and
marseille all asked me for directions!"

"small girl, big voice, loud laugh, bright smile."
"i'm not shy - i like to talk a lot, and fast! :) i have a lot of
energy, and my days tend to be very full. that said, i'm an
""introverted extrovert,"" and i know how to enjoy quiet times, too."
that despite my surname i don't look half-chinese.
"most women say the first thing they notice is my beard, my eyes or
my voice."
"my accent.... my response .. ""what accent?"""

"i'll have to check around to get a real solid answer for this one
but my preliminary answer would be:<br />

my smile and dimples<br />

i have great natural teeth<br />

people have to see me go but love to watch me leave :)"

purple stain on my face called a mongolian birthspot.<br />

at least, only children are oblivious enough to point it out."

"take a wild guess. (that box to your right may give you a hint).
and no, i did not play basketball. i did a stint on the
professional cockfighting circuit in burma, though. those were dark
years. don't want to talk about it."

my third eye ball.
that i look younger than my age and my big brown eyes and dimples.
my goof ball sense of humor?
""
"my bulging arms along with my sweet collection of affliction
t-shirts (kidding but that shit is hilarious to see). on a serious
note, probably my sick freestyle gorilla raps."
"maybe that i'm pretty tall and that some sun makes me look like i
get highlights?"
"the first thing that people notice about me is that i'm very tall
for a female. people are use to seeing tall men, but rarely do they
see tall women, especially asian women."
my eyes or my voice.
hmm. i haven't the foggiest.
i will say whatever comes to my mind!
"i talk to children and pets as if they are people.<br />
i like manly beverages.<br />
i rarely wear pants (skirts, dresses. don't worry, i'm not a

it seems weird to say this in san francisco, but i have lots of
tattoos. many of which show even when i am clothed."

more then likely my pierced eyebrow. or my odd sense of humor.
relatively strong southern accent.
my height
my smile.

i'm tall for an asian

unless you're like 6'4 or something, then i guess i'm relatively

i also have a scar on my cheek and a lip ring, people either notice
these right away or don't notice them at all for months until i

them.)"
i'm nice i hope
my eyes.
my smile. i'm always smiling.
"more than likely my beautiful bald head. they say its a hard look
to pull off, but i wear it quite well. next would probably be my
buddha tattoo on my arm. there's a long story about it so there's a
topic of discussion for you when we meet. maybe i could be corny
and say my smile or my eyes, gotten a few of those comments.
personality wise probably that i'm super caring and giving to
people that deserve it."
"i would guess most often they notice physical attributes. in my
case probably my <a class=""ilink"" href=

short sleeves. i have often been told i am a lot nicer than i look

my hair..."
"nothing. because i'm a ninja, and they didn't even notice i was
there."

first time they notice me is in their rear view mirror, in which
case the first thing they would notice is the dented front end
fender on my truck."
"hair,eyes,accent"
my big brown eyes.
"i think a lot of people are intimidated by my size when they first
see me, or even think i look mean or unapproachable. that's because
i'm usually daydreaming about world domination or being the first

"my balding head (sadly), my beard, my tattoos, my glasses. i have
been told that i 'command respect when i walk into a room'."
"people tend to compliment me on my skin, my sense of humor and then
ask me about my ethnicity."
"perhaps the way i dress? i often look like i haven't noticed yet
that the renaissance is over. i wear long dresses, always in
natural tones, with either combat boots or these little leather
purple ones that are always covered in mud. when people get closer,
perhaps the way i walk, like i said, i dance. i also smile when
there doesn't seem any reason to. i think it's ridiculous that
people need a reason to smile. i think you should need a reason not
to, and the fact that you don't seems reason enough that you do."

"i guess my size. i'm not that tall but i have pretty broad
shoulders."
"is me.<br />
<br />
who i am is impossible not to see. this means that you either you
like me right away or you don't. saves a great deal of time."
""
the first thing people usually notice about me is my eyes.
"is that i'm on fire. spontaneous combustion runs in the family
(mom's side), which is why i always carry around baking soda. after
that, they tend to notice that i'm smart, funny and articulate."
""
"it is the hair on my head. be it the beard in the front or the
curly hair on the top of it."
""
"that i look like the illegitimate love child of keanu reeves and
mario lopez."
brightly framed colorful sunglasses i bought for $5.
""
people always comment on how small i am.
"is that i like to smile, laugh and have a lot of fun."
my leather suspenders (usually connected to my jeans).
""
my eyes
my eyes and genuine honesty.
"i hear that i am compassionate pretty often. i hear my hair and
dimples often too i suppose :-)"
my hair and outfit? seriously.
"physically my eyes, mentally, my creative thinking, emotionally, my
calm demeanor."
""
my eyes and/or distinctive voice
""
"are my energy, enthusiasm and openness. when people get to know me
better, they discover my sense of humor and love of the absurd."
"people comment on my strong jawline ... funny, huh? i've also had
people tell me i look way better in person than in my pictures -
guess it's a good thing i never wanted to be a super-model :p"
"my lips or my eyes or my body or my brain or my dorsal fin or my
spirit or my heart or my gratuitous use of the word ""or.""<br />
<br />
more subtle folks note that i smell of citrus notes, rosemary
spiciness, jasmine, &amp; exotic woods.<br />
<br />
my skin is akin to the finest silks from the alpine recesses of the
orient where jade and fog dance in the misty morning dew. or some
shit. not really."
i wear vans.
how should i know? good teeth?
"literally, the first thing people notice about me is usually my
hair. it took me years to be comfortable with the unique colour,
but now that i acknowledge it, i love it! quite a few have also
said that i make them feel extremely comfortable quickly after
first meeting them and make conversation easy between people
(little do they know of the evils that i am really planning)."
""
"that i can't possibly be my age, that i'm tall &amp; hunky but they
probably also see my heart on my sleeve, and my more silver fox
than salt'n'pepper hair."
""
fun-loving and outgoing
"that would probably be my eyes, my freckles, or my broad shoulders."

one usually doesn't sing.)"

either that or the goofy smile i like to keep around.<br />
also i have a slew of tattoos including a pretty big calvin and
hobbes/dino inspired piece and few piercings, that could be pretty
noticeable too."
my jew-fro
hmm... i don't know. you tell me.
my jokes.
height and hair. both lengthy.
"my accent, it's hard to figure out where i'm from."
"personality wise? my affable nature. i hate being overly positive
about things, but i do try to see (and share) the upside of the
situation.<br />
<br />
physically? i'm skinny and tall...at 6'2"", i wear a small american
apparel tshirt, and wish everybody made their shirts in 'long'. or,
as a friend sarcastically put it, a ""euro cycling bod [sic]."""
"i guess the first thing people notice is the smile, the hair, and
my height.<br />

----------------------------..:|:..-------------------------------<br />

i've been told by many that i have a positive outlook on life, or
that being around me is like being around a living, breathing light
that carries with it a sense of warmth, kindness, and happiness.
i'm not sure what it is about me that defines these traits to
another person, but i do try what i can to make others smile, to be
there when they need someone, and to be as understanding as
possible."
people often comment on my eyes. i dont know why.
""
my words...
""
"* smile and laugh a lot<br />
* end up talking about food"
freckles and smile...
this is not my original profile.
""
"i suppose it's my warmth and calmness. i don't pretend that they're
always there for all to see, but those seem to be the most
frequently commented upon.<br />
<br />
oh, and my hair. my friends can always spot me in a crowd."
"my eyes and my charming smile! :d<br />
i also dress well"
my eyes and smile..
"that i'm so god damned relaxed and happy. perpetually sustainable
unemployment is amazing. not in a lazy couch surfer way either.
though i do have a couch.<br />
<br />
that and the alexander cotton haircut."
my eyes.
"you'll have to let me know :) although i have been complimented on
my smile and warm demeanor."
"most people i meet have a hard time believing that i do accounting;
usually they think i'm joking because i live with eccentric artists
and i usually like to talk about anything, but accounting. i'm
kinda obsessed with german culture (mostly east german, berlin wall
falling stuff) and i'm not even german (irish/english). also,
people tend to comment on how much i over dress. however, in san
francisco, it's very difficult to predict the weather. i guess i
could look at the weather report from time to time, but that's just
plain crazy. the result is me walking around the city on a hot
summer's day wearing a heavy pea coat."
"these days... its probably the dorky folding bike that i ride
around on since it makes it easier to take the train. i like to
think it builds character, but who knows."
"that i'm there.<br />
and somewhere between three seconds and 8 years people will notice
that i have two different colored eyes."
"i spend a lot of time being active. also, people often say i look a
lot like my younger sister."
my hair or my butt probably.
"non-ironic mustache.<br />
and that i look familiar? which usually makes me uncomfortable."
"probably that i'm not a small boy. i'm 6'4"" and on the heavy side,
though most people remark more on the height than the overall...
uh... size."
poor thing.
"my fake mustache, jorts (jean-shorts) and mandals (men sandals)."
i have 1 dimple
"i don't really know but i'll ask next time i meet someone new and
get back to you on this one =)"
"probably my eyes - either because they are rather a lovely shade
(i've been told) or because i'm rolling them."
"my smile and eyes, i'd say. others might say boobs. :p"
my eyes..
my beard and maybe my smile???
"i have pretty hair....or so they say. ?<br />
find out for yourself :)"
they notice i am not easy to figure out.
"people tend to note that they think i am tall. after a bit of
conversation, i usually get a comment about it being unfair that i
have really long eyelashes. (random, i know.)"
"wits and ass. also, willingness to write just about anything in my
online profile on a dare."
""
my curly hair
"blue eyes, smile and that my zipper's down. just kidding, i'm more
of a button guy."
"my sense of humor. i like to think of myself as a pretty witty
person...."
"my scowl. it's a habit! i'm not mean, i promise."
"i guess people think i'm reserved because i often get a surprised
reaction from people that don't know me well when i bust out some
sassy, snarky, or otherwise mischievous comment."
"my eyes, my fashion sense? i don't know, you tell me...."
height
that i actually wear glasses most of the time?
""
""
that i have all of my teeth?
""
my good hearted laugh or my petite stature
"you know, i have no idea."
"what ethnicity i probably am... i'm half mexican, german and irish.
people think i'm jewish and most of the time i roll with it."
"i'm a little reserved and quiet at first, but if you keep prodding
me, i will open up like an awesome blossom. they notice i tend to
be good at everything i try my hand at. i guess i just have a knack
for handling new things."
"i'm super adorable and i have a terrible tan. i also have dreamy
eyes."
"my luscious hair and fantastic ass! haha, jk, butt seriously
probably that i smile a lot."
"red curly hair (except that i recently dyed it blue, so that is
even more obvious). kind eyes."
my eyes. they're blue but look green.
from what i've been told my color changing eyes.
"my cleavage (just being honest ) my eyes or my crazy hair, my hair
, i'm convinced , is its own entity , i attempt to style it and its
all ""no way bitch i'm gonna be curly again and poof out on you , i
do what i want!"" so yea its pretty much just crazy all the time and
it eats people"
probably my nose. unless they have no depth perception.
"that every time i walk into the room, there is electricity in the
air. that's mainly because i have a tesla coil in my pocket.<br />
<br />
the job breaker on my right fore arm. its new and fresh and full of
awesome.<br />

my eyebrows, they're fabulous. seriously i have people come up to
me in the street demanding that i shave them off because they are
so awesome they shouldn't exist.<br />
<br />
my glasses which i use to hide my beautiful eyebrows."
my unusual name. hearty laugh. ashy skin? i don't know you tell me.
"is that i wear spectacles. nobody has echoed such sentiment but
that is what i am writing here.<br />
<br />
some tell me i have nice colored eyes, which is nice to hear. i
think they are cool but enjoy other people's better.<br />
<br />
people give me the whole, ""you look just like this guy i know""
bullshit. well, thank you, i'm not this other person so get over it
and try to be less of douche next time you meet someone. i've done
that recently. maybe that tells me something of my inner monologue.
the wheels are spinning."
my smile and my eyes. my hair.
my energy level. it's not low.
"friendly, affable, sociable...."
"i'm a quick-witted, smart ass, with a pearly white smile."
"my experience is likely in-line with my expression. if i am bummed
it shows ok?"
"i do not know! i think my eyes and eyebrows, since those get the
most comments : after i speak though, it's probably my quiet voice
: i'm a calm girl :::"
mischief and wit and full of strange facts
"uniqueness, i guess"
i don't know....you can tell me.
"my blue eyeballs. and my height. and my pale skin. and hopefully my
friendliness."
"my smiles.<br />
my quick comebacks."
bad guy
who is that f..king guy?
"i'm all over the board. some misinterpret my shyness as being
snobby. some say that i'm an extrovert."
"depth, laughter, comfort, and warmth. and the luscious locks."
""
"some say i'm funny; some say i'm intimidating. so i guess i'm
funtimidating!<br />
<br />
my white guy friend said that i'm actually pretty tall for an asian
guy. that made me feel really small. (he's taller than me) but i
still felt good about it."
"are probably my green eyes and some freckles.<br />
<br />
and thanks to good genes and a good lifestyle i guess i often hear
that i look much younger than i really am. thanks for the
compliment."

sense of humor
"my personality, i am a very sociable"
my eye contact?
i am really shy at first but that changes fast.
i have no idea.

"big smile and great sense of humor. my friends often tell me im the
most inspiringly and annoyingly opptimistic person they know."
my accent
""
"the gap in my front teeth. then, in no particular order, my crazy
hair, my freckles, my eyes, my snarky sense of humor."
"i'm short. (the french and politically correct americans say
""petite."") but what i lack in height, i make up for with
personality! wait, i mean, heels. yeah, heels."

myself."
my unicorn horn
my hazel eyes.
"""frown and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command..."""
"that my socks are on the wrong feet. or, are they...?"
""
"are that i am very talkative and enjoy discussing pop culture and
politics, and that i tend to be extremely cynical and mocking
towards mainstream society, but that i also hate
pseudo-intellectual pretentiousness as much as i hate the mindset
that made zookeeper a popular entertainment. but i also love roger
ebert to death, and he gave zookeeper three stars. but maybe it
gave him mild pleasure. i also go on tangents. my opinions tend to
be fairly strong."
i'm nothing like brad pitt.
"all the rings on my fingers. there is a story behind each that i'll
explain if asked. or, i'm always getting asked about the pins i
wear on my sweatshirts. i usually change it up everyday."
""
i kind of like big words.
"my charisma. i'm not intimidated by people i don't know, and am
usually joking around with them after the first few minutes."
my eyes and my smile
"red hair, big laugh, glass half full."
my smile!
"i usually have some kind of punky look to my hair, whether it's
color (currently purple/pink), or the cut (i used to have one of
those fun asymmetrical deals. at least that's what i assume is the
first thing, i could be completely wrong."

abduction scars..<br />

he sure reads too many books."
my eyes &amp; accent

bartender, by their first name. taking life seriously is for boring
people."
goooood question. i should ask people to see what they say
is my long greek last name. i'm half greek. opa!
i dunno. maybe my blue eyes.
"im different than every other guy and know how to treat a girl and
make her smile. confident, caring, smart,charming and protective of
whats mine."
"goofy attitude. and refusing to acknowledge how cool you you are...
(don't encourage them)<br />

and or patterns i am wearing."
"my big smile, big eyes, and my big personality"
"people sometimes stop me in the street to comment on my hair
colour, and when i am in london i get stared at quite a lot.
however, in san francisco i am completely normal and no-one looks
twice."
"my laugh, my eyes and my funny, observational sense of humor."
i make a lot of jokes to break the ice.
"they can't miss me = 6', blonde hair, blue eyed, confident man."
a sigourney weaver resemblance ~ that i notice curious details
my openness
i have very curly hair and i talk with my fingers.
"people who don't know me usually think i'm either shy or arrogant,
which is strange because i'm neither of those things... i guess
most of the time i'm really absorbed in thought and i don't expect
to impress everybody."

is my energy.
my emotions are easily known from my facial expressions.
"im short. really short. 4 foot 11 short. but what i lack in height,
i make up for in a double helping of personality."

i would probably say my accent.
my eyes. they're up here.

i also have a really big dog, he tends to draw a good amount of
attention too."
i'm loud and have a tattoo

more important is what people remember about me."
my easygoing nature and my smiling eyes.
i have a stripe in my eye!
my blue eyes.
pretty safe to assume my dougie is high on the list.
"my voice and smile.<br />
or so i've been told 50+ times a day, everyday at work.<br />
in social settings, still my voice."
"how my opening scene is memorable, powerful and poignent and sets
the tone for the rest of the movie without...no wait that's ""the
godfather""<br />

umm?<br />
my upbeat aura &amp; how chill i am"
"i smile and laugh a lot - i believe even the worst things in life
are easier to handle if you try to face them with a smile.<br />

that said, i definitely still have a dark, sarcastic side and a
slightly warped sense of humor."
"here comes the usual: i have been told...<br />
my intense blue eyes (they don't come off in the pictures.)"
my smile.

the reserved aspect will disappear."

crowd in this town."
"my car... it's a red classic mini cooper with the steering wheel on
the wrong side of the car."
"i have no idea. i've had people walk up to me &amp; tell me
'smile!' when i was in a good mood, which suggests i have a grim
countenance or something. otoh, i'm the person that is always
stopped for directions, which suggestions that i have a very
approachable look. weird. *shrug*"
"likely the upper midwest accent that, even after 10 years in
california, is still alive and well...or so i'm told."
"my voice- strangers often tell me i should be on radio (i was a dj
@ kxlu back in the day)."
""
"my height, my hair and my big cheese"
"maybe my style? likely to be wearing a fedora. maybe my smile? i
start out a little shy, but if i take a shine to you, look out.
maybe my energy? if i'm out w/friends, we'll be joking, laughing
&amp; more than likely, dancing."
"likely, it's that i'm smiling. (it's actually that i've found
something entertaining and am giggling to myself.) or that i tend
to speak in sound effects (not surprisingly, the idea of that
doesn't translate well to words)."
enthusiasm

curly hair and my smile
my funny colored hair or my boots
"blue eyes! i'm curious and i ask a lot of random questions???? i am
comfortable getting to the heart of the matter quickly (very
direct)"

"i'm not sure. i usually get the 'wow you look like someone i know.
have we met before?' or my favorite, 'you look like my
ex-girlfriend.' nice. i think people probably notice that i'm
approachable and easy to talk with. i make people feel comfortable.
maybe my smile..."

my eyes - so they say...
"how vocal i am about art, how hungry i am, and my passion for tea"
i can only assume

out clothes to buy because i have no eye for fashion."

also, that i tend to ask a lot of questions."
very blue eyes
"my eyes or humor, i think. or maybe my laid-backness if that counts"
that i'm wearing clothes.
"i guess i hear most about my hazel/green eyes, and that i'm taller
than most people expect. i've got a few piercings and tattoos, but
nothing too extreme (at least not in my opinion). i used to have
glasses, but not anymore!"

my laugh! it's a big laugh coming out of a 5' tall girl.

my eyes
"i'm from india and have had girls say that they really like my lips
but that's about it."

i'm laid back and like to have fun
"my height. if i had a nickel for the number of times someone has
asked me ""do you play basketball?"" but it's cool ... i love being
tall. people ask me to grab stuff off the top shelf at the grocery
store. long airplane flights are brutal, though. and hotel showers
aren't really designed for tall people."

that is fun and caring and full of life then give me a try.<br />

but in all seriousness, i think the first thing people usually
notice is how skinny i am, that is when i'm not turned sideways. i
really can't help it. i've been trying to gain weight for nearly 10
years. it just doesn't happen. right before i moved here, i've
learned to embrace it so i went out a bought a pair of skinny
jeans.<br />

i get asked for id in whole foods. people usually <em>don't</em>

where from though, as my accent isn't as thick as other spaniard's.
i am blonde and white which normally makes people think i am not

yeah sorry it's hard for me to see letters by themselves instead of
just seeing what the word looks like. is that dyslexia? i'm not
sure, i mean a doctor told me i have it but who knows with these
quacks running around with their oxycontin prescriptions. assholes.
what was i talking about? oh yeah. don't do drugs kids."
my tail.

"people usually notice that i am pretty down to earth and like to
have fun. i try not to take things too seriously."
the way i speak.
...are usually incorrect.
this is a daft question. i have no farking idea.
i am charming and charismatic.
that i smile a lot and have a generally happy/cheerful personality.
"take note, i am actually 6'4"". so typically they notice a head
bobbing above a sea of other, less compelling heads."
my curly red hair and zest for life.
my smile and eyes.
my smile
"that i think about weird things, that i have an interest in things
like semiotics and why sea slugs are awesome. i tend to jump around
a lot when i'm excited as if i was a two year old."
i'm trying to look everyone in the eyes.
""
that they are drowning as they look into my deep blue eyes.
"well that all depends, doesn't it. what lens are you looking
through?<br />
<br />
people usually remark on the physical shape i'm in (which is
kick-ass for any age).<br />
<br />
aside from that, my gay boyfriend says i'm young, playful and
funny. my girlfriend says i'm sexy, stylish and wise. (she also
thinks i'll never meet my man online. i'd love to prove her wrong.)
my pilates clients say they want a body like mine, my dance
students find me kinesthetic and poetic and my friend's dog, well,
every time he sees me he wants to lick my legs."
my accent
dimples :)
my ability to make them laugh
people usually see me as a kind caring guy who's fun to be around.
"such a narcissistic question (this whole thing is really) but
probably my height. i'm petite and proud though admittedly, i do
love rocking six inch heels. i hope i never fully look my age - i'm
fine with being mistaken for 21 to this day. i'm excessively
mistaken for latina or filipina, though i like to keep people
guessing ;)"
"a strong, confidant vibe. and my glasses."
freckles

my smile
"well, i think the best description of someone's feelings about
running into me was ""i don't so much meet him as encounter him"". i
suppose that's good. really though, they probably notice either the
strange muttering noises / wild gestures / odd expressions that i
am making if i'm in a weird-people-out mood (which can be fun) ...
or ... nothing at all, depending on what mood i'm in. i am
entertaining ... this is what people tell me."
the incongruence between my name and appearance.
my eyes and the playful remarks falling out of my face.
""
"i'm taller than the average girl even in my socks. i guess they
grow us bigger in texas, as the saying goes. my sense of humor
often brings comments as well as my varied appetite for books,
music, food and spirituality."
that my phone is a 10 year old nokia brick.
"that i am insanely happy. if not that, then they usually say i look
like a celebrity or some random person they know. i have a list of
doppelgangers a mile long; not all accurate, in my opinion, i mean
seriously, do i really look like david hasselhoff?"
"idk. i'm klutzy so i'm probably falling down, or hitting myself on
something, or knocking something over most of the time. maybe that,
i mean falling face first in the middle of the street tends to get
a lot of looks."
my smile. my freckles. i forget i even have them
"quiet, observant, sporty, irreverent"
"fun-loving spirit, passion for life, and huge smile"
"my height and size (i'm six feet and 220), my long hair and short
beard, my casual way of dressing (people and relationships are
important to me; stylish clothes -- not so much), the mindful way i
use language. my ""spot the naked emperor"" sense of humor."
my laugh carries. you might hear me before you see me.
"crazy red hair. next, being totally out there (or out of it? =p),
maybe scientifically, maybe intellectually, or there's always the
occasion where i come off as crazy (probably not in a bad
way).<br />
<br />
sometimes they notice my strange use of metaphor and analogy.
perhaps i'm surrounded by computer monitors, buried in programming
code, diagrams, and math. maybe i'm taking pictures of a moonrise
on a beach or laying in the sand enjoying the lightning play out in
the distance. perhaps i'm pacing in a field at night thinking about
the world."
probably my hair...i think it's my best feature.
i'd have to say the goiter.
"multi-racial, easy-going, lots of energy, lived everywhere..."

which one was joking ;)"
i keep things light and have a good sense of humor.

my charming personality of course!
my inability to grow facial hair

always smiling, lol."
"i'm really geeky - i know a little about a lot of different things.
a couple of friends call me google."

sandals."

my necklace.
"would be my long hair, devilish grin, always happy and smiling
attitude and probably a stereotypically ridiculously geeky
t-shirt.<br />

my long hair, my dance moves, and my usually huge grin on my face
from just enjoying life. :)"
"i'm usually pretty animated and happy. i listen to people and like
to have meaningful conversations, even if it's with somebody i just
met."
my smile and my sense of humor
""
""
"i'm often told i dress pretty impressively for a straight
guy.<br />
i hug like i mean it because i do  and i do often. are you
pensively peering at that, wondering if a lingering embrace is a
means i employ to take liberties with your body? tsk really, girl,
attend to your shameless thoughts of me! preferably with me in
attendance? :)<br />
i'm easy to talk to. i prefer to think i'm an attentive, active
listener who believes everyone is worth knowing a little bit and
some are worth knowing a whole lot better.<br />
of the body? just click photos. what you can't get off them is how
it's often been said i have ""perfect hands"" (whatever that means)
and i smell really good."
my big eyes i guess or my mustache. i've never asked anyone...
"how i run around unshaved in a crumpled up tshirt trying to find a
rich woman who will spoil me for the rest of my life. it's written
all over my face. ok rich women of okcupid you heard me... waiting
for your messages. go! ... oh, and i don't care how much money you
have: ... no fatties!"

"my height, searing guitar licks, or me feeling them up"
"my smile, my blue eyes, and yes, my rack too."
my eyes.

long eye lashes. i guess i should be grateful that it isn't a
massive wart on my nose or noxious body odor or something. (i have
neither of those things)."
my hair. it is red.
"eyes, lips, legs, body shape, tits, ass.<br />
let's be real."
"probably the facial hair. that's usually where the eyes go to
first."
"you'll have to help me with this one. maybe that i look a decade
younger than i am."
perhaps my frida kahlo hair... sans the unibrow?
"that i am very cool, obviously."
""
"visually: curly hair, blue eyes.<br />
personality-wise: sleeping wit, warmth, candor."
"i'm pretty tall and thin. sometimes people notice the eyes and
debate with others about what color they are. i'm pretty plain
spoken. if you make me laugh or smile then you get to see my
dimple."
my socks. are. awesome.

"that they can't tell what race i am (my mom is malaysian/indonesian
and my dad is german/french)<br />
my hair is bigger than my waist."
that i don't give a fuck.
"probably my smile...though i don't do enough of it. i also get
comments about my arms, butt, and height - it just depends on the
context and who is doing the noticing."
my eyes apparently.
that i'm talking to them when they don't know me
"i've been told i have nice eyes. i can be quiet. i have a dry wit.
i don't like to say, ""just kidding"" after saying things that i was
clearly kidding about."
my accent
"probably that i'm laughing really loud at my own dorky jokes. i
crack myself up."
curls
"i'm told i project a sort of humble confidence. honestly, the
humility is probably thinly veiled self-doubt and the confidence is
nothing more than an expression of the comfort i feel with most
people."
"i'm not exactly sure. probably my subversive sense of humor. or my
blue eyes, soon to be adorned with glasses."
"voice, humor, wit - yes, i am a character. ordinariness is
<em>teddibly</em> (read w/ a stiff british accent) boring, but i
tolerate it with a poker face. despite my cynicism, i try to make

kind...i do well at cocktail parties ,with people's parents, and
little kids like me..."

"i've been told by multiple close friends that they found me
surprising...but you'll have to ask them what they meant by that."
i have an easy going charm. i've been told i have southern ways.
i will tell you the truth.
that i'm outgoing and have an appealing voice (so i'm told).
is different for everyone. frankly you'd have to ask them.
"that i'm obnoxious, but in a fun way."
"my eyes, followed by my freezing cold hands, but you know what they
say ""cold hands warm heart!"""
my friendliness and my eyes
"how not tall i am<br />
how funny or rude i am (they can't tell and neither can i
anymore)<br />
how young i look"
my eyes
my boots....i have a small collection
"i look taller than i am (yup, i'm actually tall, but good posture
accentuates my height), i smile and laugh a lot, i have kind eyes
(or at least that is what i was told by an 8th grade student), and
i am easily set off on tangential explorations of random ideas."
"my hair, its really long and i intend on keeping it that way"
eyelashes.
"my unbearable lightness of being. maybe my mohawk, or that weird
stuff is shaved into the side of it (currently some kind of circuit
diagram).<br />
<br />
oh oh oh, i know. how adorrrrable i am. *nodnod*"
"i'm tall. it gets annoying when you regularly have people say,
""wow, you're really tall,"" so i've just started replying, ""wow,
you're really short."" i love the reaction i get."
"the accent..... definitely the accent. i say ""choona"" instead of
""tuna"", so what? and if i want to eat a ""tomahhtoe"" with my choona,
that's fine too. scotland was a country like a billion years before
that columbo guy or whatever came and ""discovered"" america. if
anyone's wrong it's you guys! thanks for listening.<br />
<br />
this is a silly question. i don't think i've ever been like,
""hey...by the way...what was the first thing you noticed about me?
my eyes? arse? what was it?!"""
health o this is a current picture
my sense of style.
i have no idea! perhaps my good looks? maybe my gorgeous jew curls?
is that i smile a lot.
i'm funny and quick-witted and tend to speak the truth.
"my height. somehow i magically appear to be taller than my actual
height.... well ok maybe its due to sky high platforms i tend to
wear to disguise my shortness. lol. i prefer a view of the world
from above! what else? it would probably have to be my :). i have a
natural tendency to carry a smile through any random daily human/
animal interactions."
"i'm tall. seriously: i know. thanks for pointing it out. yes, my
parents were tall. no, i don't play basketball."
"mh... my smile??? ... to be honest, it seems i'm the kind of person
that can portray different first impressions... some people think
i'm stupid, some don't... some think i'm brave, some don't some
think i'm... you got the idea..."
"my eyes, pretty much. i have really startling green-grey eyes. i
have a great body, but i've no idea which part of it people notice
first.<br />

idea what she meant but was shocked and hurt by the comment, and

"the first things people usually notice about me is that i am
thoughtful and organized."
"how incredibly energetic i am. i enjoy working out so that usually
means i have lots of energy and am very happy and positive."
"my smile is usually what people comment on or my hair, and then
that i look like someone else - which isn't too bad because it's
usually a famous actress. what i can't figure out is how i can look
like so many people who look so different from each other."

so maybe my personality hah"
"smile, energy"
my mild accent and my friendliness
...that i am asian?! or am i?
"i'm always laughing, so that's probably the first thing. i'm the
type of girl that people come up to saying, ""you know who you look
like?"" and then ramble off names of celebrities that i should know.
the most common names/combination of names have been reese
witherspoon, jenny mccarthy, and pink."

i put out an approachable friendly energy.
"hmm, i'll try for an accurate recollection of what people have
said:<br />
'you're short' was one; (that was a grumpy rockstar, who presumably
put in an order for a giant). i get a lot of comments on my eyes,
smile, soft voice, sharp wit, accent, attitude and humour.
otherwise i'm okay."

people(surprisingly on a bike ride as i was passing a stranger)
that i smell like i just stepped off the washing machine smelling
like fresh laundered clothes."
"aside from the typical stuff, i always notice a person's voice. a
good voice is a great thing. a friend once told my voice is a mix
of the masculine and the feminine. i liked that."
not quite sure. perhaps you can tell me.
neutrality

"it largely depends on the person. everyone notices different
things."

within a minute."

i have no idea. my presence...my height...my hair.

waist, and too small in the chest. it makes shopping super
difficult!<br />

never (though very justin-bieberish. ) is one of my mottos."
"i wonder..perhaps that i'm 'euro' (style not trash)?! fine by me
cause i am."
i never look happy when i'm in public.
"my eyes and eyelashes (thanks mom). my attitude as well. i consider
myself to be a very positive person. people often tell me i can
turn the worst of occasions into a reason to celebrate. i have
learned that it's far too easy to let this world drag us down. we
have to think positive and remain motivated to improve ourselves in
every way possible. life is precious so lets celebrate each day

what's up with that either)."
"the situation i have going on with my abs. yeah, i wish. i have no
idea what people notice about me. one guy thought i was a
dad.<br />
another thought i was japanese (?!). i'm good at a lot of things,
but crafting an exterior image isn't one of them. a lot of people
think i'm 6"" even though i really am 5""10. i must carry myself
tall."

brown eyes."
i laugh a lot.

people i don't know well yet."

and take notice of my weird print t-shirts on more than one
occasion. usually when i'm wearing something crazy, like when i'm
dressed as a giant toe, people will stop and ask me about it."
i'm rather observant and i love to make people laugh.

time"
"i got swag (but really, it's just a painfully fractured toe)"
generaly my really loud laugh. it reverberates.
"i asked a few people about this, because i really couldn't say. i
figured might be something like my cup size, because that's what i
notice first about other people, male or female. apparently it's my
eyes though, or at least the iris part of them, which is made up of
equal parts blue and green."

maybe my smile ... 3 years of painful braces !

i'd prefer it be girls that compliment me, but hey - i can't be too

are my eyes or sometimes my slight midwest accent when i talk fast

height), but after that... hopefully my smile and my open and
outgoing nature. perhaps that i can make you laugh."

trend is on the out."
i believe it would be the red hair!

colour or shape often. second to my hair is my labret or tattoo."

i'm always smiling. i rarely have a bad day.
i'm vaguely noticable
"that i have a sort of bad-ass, don't-give-a-shit countenance. i'm
really a fun, happy person once you get to know me, and i care
about the people in my life a lot. i'm much more pleasant than i
look, so i've been told."
i laugh a lot.
"sometimes people just see a ruff exterior at times but thats due to
being guarded...they see all the colorfull tattoo's and think bad
boy, but if they only knew i clean up real real well...i also work
in marketing so i'm in the public eye a lot and with that have to
look business professional..."

in embarrassingly amusing ways."

me."

i'm really not sure but if i had to guess i'd say eyes...
"not the slightest idea. many theories though :). i suspect
different things to different people."

i'm nervous and you know what i mean... a date compared me to maria
bamford and after watching her skits, i would have to agree..."
"i'm asian. yep, it's true. specifically people think i'm japanese
but i'm taiwanese. boy were you wrong! then, if said people could
see past race for a split-second (just kidding!), they might first
notice my lips. uh, hey a little eye contact please! no idea how it
came up but once two straight male friends had a conversation about
how nice my lips looked. aside from that, probably my sense of

it's not cool. i say this as someone who generally used to date men
who were considerably older than me- i'm not saying those
relationships can't be awesome, and have healthy dynamics, but if
that is all you are looking for you need to check what's up with
you. i'm pretty amazed by how much of that is on here."

be a bit reserved, it does not take me long to shed that and become
very open."

things. if you looked at me, you'd see a face with two eyes a nose
and a mouth....you can look at my pictures if that's what you want
to know. let me know what you notice first.<br />

i just recently found out i have catch phrases...like, ""ook"" to the
tune of a sarcastic sentence and also, ""i was like..what!?"" while
laughing on the ""what""...i guess it's kind of hard to explain so if

they will happen."

it was a sign of rebellion and i chose to get my ear pierced to

probably notice them, but i try not to go out in public with them."

like i've borrowed its car and returned it with an empty tank of
gas.<br />

people ask if i dye (?!?) the natural gray patch i have on the top
of my head. the skunk-patch (which appeared in my early 30s) is

to cut it, but people in my life threatened to cry if i did.<br />

i've been told that i have a nice smile that lights up my eyes,

first meeting, i'll probably be nervous so you might not see me
really smile until i know you a little better.<br />

you if i really like you. i'm really sorry, i know it gives mixed
signals but i'm trying to work on it."

i have no idea. probably my voice, i've been told it's deep."

good way to guage a person you've just met is to run a dirty joke

if they put their arm on top of my head as a resting place, that
pisses me off real good..<br />

i enjoy my personal space and don't want people touching me unless
i express it is okay to get physical. in cases where they are
making fun of me for being short, i definitely don't want them
touching me. the worst is when i am at a social gathering and the
person is drunk and yelling over the music ""has anyone ever told
you that you are short?"" with spit flecks hitting my face and their

suddenly discover that someone you're getting to know for the first

same values and emotions that make it feel as if you've known each
other for the longest time already. as you find yourself fascinated

something to them -- i've been told i have ""expressive eyes."""
i'm smiling most of the time.

"everyone says smile because, frankly, the first thing people notice
about anyone are the eyes and smile so that's no fun. outside of
that, people on my team say i have fierce/assertive hand gestures,

this week, so some people notice them."

idea who you are. yes, i think it's beautiful too and i feel
blessed to be a natural redhead. at this point in time that
shouldn't be a problem....i went brunette... ;)<br />

"probably the shaved head, ear rings and a couple of tattoos. no
sleeves or anything :) my bike and running racing and climbing has

"the level of focus in my eyes or the hot-messness of my current
hair style"

american accent to the accent of who i'm speaking to (this has
worked for new yorkers, japanese, southerners, mexicans, arabs,

i'm sort of tall and a redhead."

constantly about it! people also notice that i smile and laugh
pretty easily."

harder for that look."
if you walked by me in the hallway would you take a second glance?

some people say i come off as cocky. i'm not. i know how to
recognize the good and bad in myself, as well as others, and
sometimes i can be overly blunt when pointing them out.<br />
<br />
some people think i'm a player. i'm not. i just got out of an
abusive year-long relationship with a girl i wanted to marry some
day. i've been cheated on at least seven times in the past. don't
call me a player.<br />

decide."

religion, but i have passion and energy for life that tends to

a certain amount of intensity that can surface in that role."
"that i am a mix of some kind of ethnicities, but it's not apparent
which ones i am."
i dunno you tell me? i get a lot of look alike comments...
"i have a very cynical sense of humor. i'm always looking for some
turn of phrase or ironic comment that will make the people around
me chuckle. i'm not a ray of sunshine - but somehow i do make my
friends happier."

lanky guys, we might just work. i dress stylishly, except when i'm
too lazy to be bothered."
"few people ever seem to read me correctly. i come across as shy,
sweet, innocent, and only mildly tomboyish. in actuality i'm catty,
jaded, and distrusting. my tomboyishness is probably the only thing
people typically correctly read about me on first impression. i had
two older brothers growing up, and have always preferred running
through the mud, rough-housing, and action figures to the more
assumed girly activities. at the same time i'm addicted to baby the
stars shine bright and love pink, and lace, and frills. i guess i'm
trying to say that i'm hard to read, but in general people don't
realize it. i'm not your average lady."

would make if they were self-conscious.<br />

physique (i'm just keepin it real!) lol. my style. my humor and out
going personality, i like making people feel comfortable upon first
interaction, unless they suck, which is kinda out of my hands
anyway....."
"it depends on how these people meet me. but one thing that stands
out is that i'm a perfectionist."
"my height, my hair, my voice,"
"long hair, scar under left eye. big nose.<br />
a lot of people i meet either instantly or eventually fall in love
with my hair. they always wanna touch it d:"
"i think most people find that i'm either funny, shy, smart, or
weird. honestly i don't know though, i don't go around
asking.<br />
<br />
if i go a couple months without a haircut i get a lot of comments."
"i suppose that would depend on the person, wouldn't it?"
my smile
""
""
...aside from my height...the first things are my eyes.
my smile. no doubt!
that i'm a caucasian male
""
i have an expressive face. it's my achilles heel.
"the fire is near me. then perhaps they notice my eyes.<br />
<br />
my ancestors came from the isle of man - where men originated."
"""oh my god...your laugh...i heard you before i came in the room. is
that real?""<br />
<br />
if you make it far enough to meet me, you'll know what i am talking
about almost immediately."
"my natural red hair and eyes. my out going personality, i'm not
shy."
people generally hear me before they see me. some call me obnoxious
"i'm a great listener, and really easy to get along with."
"that i'm not one person, i'm several!"
"that something is wrong with my eyes, because that's usually the
case (stupid contacts).<br />
<br />
otherwise, it's the big, goofy grin because i just saw something
shiny or tasty-looking."
""
i'm almost always wearing a band t-shirt.
"that i am not a good fly fisherman. just kidding, i don't even know
if i'm a good fly fisherman because i have never tried it. but i
did see a river runs through it' and now feel like i have a better
idea how to do it. seriously though, before you get too excited, i
don't actually care about fly fishing at all."
my laughter. i laugh often and loudly.
my rait tail/bowl cut combo hair style
you tell me haha
"this guy is the ""nice guy"". 5'10"" with shoes.<br />
<br />
i get compliments for having a nice physique. my chest is probably
my most prized physical possession or arms.<br />
<br />
they know i'm asian but they think i'm filipino because of my
darker skin. i'm outside in the sun a lot on the job and getting a
tan apparently."
are my cheerful smiles and long black hair.
"my neutral/thinking/by myself expression is sometimes kind of
intense. people think im mad a lot when im not.<br />
<br />
personally i like my legs.<br />
<br />
im also kind of a space case.<br />
<br />
people have told me my eyes are nice.<br />
<br />
and so is my ass."
my bike is really orange.
""
"probably my hair, because i usually have too much of it. or that
i'm explaining something and gesturing enthusiastically."
my glasses.
"my huge muscles. haha my friend said to say that. um, i love
laughing."
i am of an indiscernible ethnic background.
"i'm small and skinny. i wear coach flats and a batman hoodie. since
happiness occurs in the brain i smile all the time. confidence also
occurs in the brain. i think people can see that as soon as they
meet me."
""
i look and act younger and am drawn toward openings.
fleet feet!
"enthusiasm!<br />
conspicuous dairy consumption<br />
a healthy appetite for *everything*"
"i am tall (6'3""), and i smile and sing a lot.<br />
<br />
i tend to be serious at first, but people are soon surprised by how
funny i can be. soon they realize i don't take <em>anything</em>
seriously."
my smile and long legs
i'll find out and get back to you on this one
"i'd say my smile. i have what my father calls a ""quality
grill.""<br />
<br />
update! a russian guy in a bar told me that russians look for
strong jawlines and collarbones, and that i have both. and then he
jabbed me in the face and chest with his finger a bunch of times.
soooo..."
"i'm loaded with personality and i make bad jokes. if you posess
those qualities, we'll be just fine"

high school"

i have no idea. i'll be sure to ask the next person i meet. haha.
that i have a lot to say?
"i am a bit shy, but i am a nice genuine person."
""
"i talk with my hands when i'm excited. seriously, if you make me
sit on my hands i can't continue the story."
people usually notice my smile.
"are my intoxicating eyes, they are a mysterious color from a far
away land."
"the way i dress. i dress very well for work but like to wear jeans
and t-shirts. usually my t-shirts say something funny."
"smile, eyes, laugh."
"my laugh! i am amused very easily &amp; laughing is super important
to me!"
"people usually notice my sarcastic sense of humor. if there's a
somewhat funny commentary about a situation, i'm on it."
"my brown eyes, super rare"
"the eyebrows. yes, they're big. no, you can't pluck them. i like
being the asian eugene levy."
-blue eyes
i'm a really nice guy.
""
you would have to tell me.
""
""
"i have no idea; that i tend to be quite reserved until i get to
know people? i tend to run silent and run deep."
i'm even better looking and more amazing in real life.
""
smile
"they don't notice me. everyone is a walking billboard. from the man
in a suit and tie, to the thug sagging his pants to his knees, to
the chick showing her cleavage."
""
""
"red hair? mischievous air? you tell me.<br />
<br />
my friend natalie would say wit."
my clothes &amp; my hair.
"i guess there really is no accounting for people's tastes. i've
been complimented by strangers/new acquaintances on my blue eyes
and full lips a lot. i've got big legs and ghetto booty for a white
boy and they often garner attention. a lot of people seem to really
like the way i talk, because i've still got a touch of the relaxed
louisiana drawl in everything i say. my sense of style gets plenty
of random comments as well--especially from homeless people."
"often i am told i am like a goofier version of carrie from sex and
the city."
""
"i talk really quickly and have a big laugh.<br />
<br />
oh and i'm short."
""
"eyes and/or tits. and my waist and hips o:<br />

theres also this utter surprise people get when i tell them i'm
brazilian. yep, we come in white, too xd<br />
can you say...italian and german immigration after wwii? also a ton
of japanese and such- kay, getting ahead of myself."
what i'm wearing. also that i look taller in my photos.
my mullet
"my smile, my big lips, and my eyes. sometimes, they notice my nose.
then i open my mouth, and people find me to be funny, sharp and
endearing--even in spite of myself!"
"i don't think i've ever asked anyone that question, i will have to
get back to you."
"awake, alert, oriented, well-developed, wiry young man in no
apparent distress, with a large nose. appears younger than his
stated age of 30. moves all extremities spontaenously, denies
complaints at this time.<br />
<br />
(i resent that okc will only allow me to describe my build as
""skinny,"" ""thin,"" or ""fit;"" i'm wiry, not those other
things).<br />
<br />
i suspect, though i'm not sure, that many people may think i look
helpful on first sight, because i often have people approaching me
in public places, asking for directions to the bathroom, or to a
specific part of some store i'm at, or various different things
like that. what's with that?"
my accent.
""
"most people notice that i'm pretty energetic. i'm always bouncing
around work doing things to keep busy. being active has really kept
me looking young. folks are always surprised when i tell them i'm
forty."
i have absolutely no idea - perhaps that i am always smiling :)
my eyes or my smile

tend to notice that. also, my eyes squint when i smile. people like
pointing that out too."
""
""
"my ""sense of humor"" (quotes intentional)"
"sincerity. my eyes, my smile, followed by my laugh."
"probably my eyes<br />
and my sense of humor"
my smile
"first would be my hazel eyes. second, that i really listen. third,
that i call things as i see them. fourth, that i number lists for
no good reason."
my sweet calculator watch.
i enjoy being drawn upon.
that i don't resemble denzel washington.

my smile ( i have decent teeth)"
"my height and then my eyes...lot of people have told me that i have
bedroom eyes. not exactly sure what it means though...lol."
no idea. maybe you can let me know in a message?
probably the smile
"blonde, short, generally happy. hidden wit;)"

and my hair. next would be the way i communicate. i can be fairly
articulate in person."
""
""
my charming smile and blue eyes.... oh and i have a nice butt too.
""
easy going and drama free
"people usually say i look like some celebrity or someone they
already know. most common celebrities people say i look like are
harry hamlin, johnny depp and bill bob thornton. supposedly i look
like someone on the soap operas too but i don't watch them or know
who he is."
my hair.
"this is such a dumb question. clearly you, as a person, have
already ""noticed"" something about me by the time you get here. it's
unimportant what others noticed before you."
i look really young looking and a model type.
""
beard
is my hair (i got lucky in the hair dept.)
my light skin or slim body.
you tell me...
"my eyes and smile. how outgoing i am and that i never stop
laughing."
"lately i've been seeing that people notice my feet (for good
reasons i hope!)."
"oh i dont know, i see myself everyday. how dark my hair is? yes, my
thick, lustrous mane. sure, lets go with that for now."
"new people usually notice that i am shy with people i don't know.
this is a bit of a problem in the ""first impressions""
department.<br />
<br />
in such situations, i'm polite (i'm always polite, though) but
sometimes come off as aloof due to the shyness.<br />
<br />
people are often surprised at the apparent change in my personality
once i become more comfortable around them.<br />
<br />
this obviously isn't my strong suit. next questions, please."
how tall i am!
"my eyes, my smile and my confidence get me the most comments. but
you tell me. what do you notice?"
i tell stories. and my evil grin.
i hug everybody.

im confident<br />
i have an opinion<br />
im intimidating in a good way<br />
i have devious smile"
"because of my work, people usually first notice my serious,
thoughtful side but i can also be quite silly and love a good
laugh."
"my height is probably it. i am nearly two meters tall for those of
you who speak metric. i do have a very deep voice so people on the
phone comment on that a lot. appearance and the like aside, i am
often very outgoing and am not afraid to speak my mind. in fact i'm
not afraid of much, which is probably why i am an adventure junkie."
my hair (it's big).
"probably my loud laugh! i give myself freely to enjoyment, and i
don't put much of a limit on it. :d or, you know, maybe it's my big
ass. you tell me!"
smile :)
i am quite small in size but have a pretty large personality
i'm tall
"my height, my presence (in the eyes), the time i spend listening
before i speak, and then finally, of course, what i say if i speak."
""
you tell me!
"it's got to be my beard, right? otherwise, my sense of humor and
wittiness."
you tell me!

to be positively surprised.<br />

on shopping sprees in chinatown, my fellow - lifelong experienced -
shopping grandmas acknowledge cinderella-esque selection
skills.<br />
<br />
recently, a massage therapist (15 minutes corporate/ chair massage
- nothing fancy) mentioned ""you have positive energy..""; so just in
case you are a massage therapist, you might notice that
first.<br />
<br />
other than that i do not wear speedos but i could."

energy. the way i dance. my politeness is always notice. the way i
carry myself is also appreciated and noticed. my body. my passion
for dance."
""
my eyes.
"i asked 3 friends and they all gave me different answers. i guess
it depends where we met, and if i was alone or with friends. one
thing in common tho, they could tell that there's a tomboy inside
me."
"1. the soft glow of my internal awesomeness.<br />
2. the purple suit and aquarium shoes i generally wear around
town.<br />
3. my eyes, kind of an odd blue-grey like a cloudy sky. maybe that
reflects something deep about my personality, or maybe it just
reflects certain patterns of deoxyribonucleic acid :)<br />
4. i'm a little bit of a geek, and i have a unique sense of humor
:p"
"i have a good smile<br />
i'm easily amused"
"my eyes and that i don't have an accent (i was born and raised in
belgium)"

are ""the flight attendant"", ""the shimmy jangle"" and the pending
trademarked ""lavender hip storm."""
i don't know......help me out with this one!
"the red hair. the fact that i don't tend to pull punches. (people
also generally say my eyes and smile, but that just sounds so
cliche and cliche's make me laugh. and not in the
""ha-ha-that's-so-funny"" way. more like the
""this-is-so-contrived-that-it-feels-ridiculous"" kind of way.)"
"a. i have big eyes for an asian.<br />
b. i'm short.<br />
c. i look young.<br />
d. i have freckles. insert obligatory comment on how i kind of look

they think i can see into them<br />
i'm inspirational"

listener/observer. people assume that i'm shy. i'm not."
"well, according to my profile picture (among others), i'm probably
safe to say my tongue... and no that's not peanut butter on it,
it's just the reflection of the light."
my sideburns and glasses(yes there are lenses in them)

people laugh. not everybody gets my humor at first and that's okay,
but those that do, love it. i make all my friends laugh and they've
been around for a long time, so i must be doing something right.
the second thing is probably my butt. actually that might be the
first thing people notice, depends on the gender doing the
noticing."

it looks!"

difficult times. i think a lot of people also notice my laughs. i
have different types, and they are all quite loud and quite
distinct.<br />

beyond that, people notice my capacity to talk and my energy."
"my east european accent. friends say i am ""chill"" and i never
worry. perhaps they are mislead by my calm and easy nature but i do
tend to solve most life problems without drama."

gallows humor."

drift.<br />

"my smile and sense of humor. people tell me i look much younger
than my actual age-lucky me."
""
""
"i have been told a lot of times that - i look better in person than
in my pics (i guess not that photogenic. sad - it kills any
modeling career i could have had, haha - but better than looking
good in pics and not so good in person), that i have a nice body
and that i have a great smile. but to me, these are all
subjective.<br />
<br />
i have a slight accent, so that would be something you would
notice. if you made me nervous, you will definitely notice it ;-)"

a pretty good sense of humor."

connect with."

somewhere along the road: ""you are stronger than i thought."""

people tell me they notice my smile.
"my smile, eyes (they change from blue to gray), sense of humor, and
tattoos. i'm sure there are more so you'll have to tell me what you
noticed first."

my abnormally flexible body. ask me about the screws keeping it
together some time."
"eyes, smile, boobs"
"this one is easy!! i am tall, slim, and physically fit. if someone
doesn't notice that then next up is my smile.<br />
<br />
***if i'm on the beach it is that i'm tall, slim, physically fit,

the hearts going up the back of my legs. (ps...if you have to ask
about the size or location of my tattoos, i'm probably not for you)"
physical presence

that would be the second runner up"
my eyes

"probably my eyes, followed by smile, and then my laugh. let me know
when we meet."
"my lip ring and how ""scary"" it looks or my sweet native tan (which
is slowly starting to fade in this sf weather)."

the cute shoes? christian louboutin said, ""the language of legs can
express any and every feeling, and without giving too much away,
the body becomes the flame."""

"the first thing people *should* notice is that i've got a new cool
jacket. literally everyone i know is talking about it; it's a
pretty big deal. the inside pockets are labelled with tiny little
patches so that i'll know what to put in them. my favorite is the
flask pocket followed by the old-timey phone pocket. it's ironic
because an old-timey phone wouldn't fit. i keep gum in that
pocket.<br />
<br />
if you notice me in the jacket and you need gum, i probably have
some. the second thing people notice about me is how much i hate
sharing. do not ask for gum!"

good question. i'm not sure. i will ask around.
"i've had silver hair since i was about 25. seriously. hazel eyes to
match. and a quick wit and great gams. i can be a bit sharp at
first. more patient observers eventually figure out i've got very
strong ethical instincts and can be extremely kind -- but i'll take
no prisoners if i think i'm being had."
"my feather eyelashes (ok, only on special occasions). my dulcet
tones."
no clue.
"i am exhaustingly approachable. i'm chubby and taller than you. i
don't really have any motivation to be that cool. i am happy, but
usually the wrong amount of scared at any given time. my hair is

blonde. maybe other things? i'm really goofy and joke around a lot
so people probably notice that right off the bat too."
probably my eyes (blue with long lashes) or my freckles

knowledge of the fact that it would last 5 years (or even until the

apart from expected societal norms in every moment and gain
perspective on myself and my surroundings."

right ridiculous about every 90 seconds) and i love to laugh!"

fact that i look identical to my sister. not that it's a bad thing,
the twins questions is actually fascinating, mostly because we're
not twins (just both quite white and of the same facial
persuasion), and upon learning this, people can always determine
who is older in less than a second. a favorite social experiment!"

a strange quirk that i have: i hiccup after i eat anything.
honestly. it doesn't matter whether it's a full meal, or if i just
have a couple of grapes, i hiccup *at least* once. when it's really
bad (usually, when someone gets me laughing) i can hiccup for a few
minutes afterwards... yeah, i know it's weird, and no, i haven't
figured out what causes it or how to stop it. have i had this

smile a lot."
the halo shining atop of my head.
my smile and then my sparkling personality : )
"i used to dress like a clown working in a library, and my pink hair
stood out in australia, but now that i've retired all of that, it
might be my banjo or my loudness. unless i'm being pensive, in
which case it's the reverse."
darned if i know. or care.

i'm going to go with humor. or that i am just awesome.

no one every guesses that correctly. secondly i would have to say
the gap in my teeth. people tell me its sexy...i don't know about
that. my mother had a gap and so did my grandmother. that's the
only reason i never got it fixed."
i'm a tall asian and therefore a walking oxymoron.

i'm constantly dancing...dance floor...car...desk...dancing.

shampoo commercial hair, but really, the top thing is almost
certainly my unicorn tattoo. i've had lots and lots of random
people ask about/compliment the tattoo because it's so awesome.
it's done in japanese brush painting style so it's sparse and
simple and beautiful. like me!"

very happy smile, or my eyes. i don't really look half-asian, but
my eyes are probably where it shows up most - just enough to
confuse people about my ethnicity, apparently, like the woman who
walked up to me on the street and said, ""i know you're something,

plug"" is often used. i know how to speak my mind and get what i
want, but i do so with a smile. i've been known to assess first
impressions quickly (both personally and professionally) and
generally do not waiver from my initial conclusion. i'm considered
a very generous person in all aspects of my life especially in
friendship, family and love. i've been told that i'm smart,
beautiful and sensitive, although i also tend to be a bit modest
too. i'm looking for a man who shares my views on love, family and
friends and is ready for all of it to begin with me."

"people tend to notice my enthusiasm/passion for interests, and i
can talk about them forever. i can at times talk too much about
things i am passionate about, but i am also a practiced listener. i
enjoy a good friendly argument, and can talk about just about
anything for any length of time. i can be pretty intense and
passionate about my interests, but i've mellowed out in my old age
and prefer just to get along with people vs. proving i know more
than them about things. i'm trying to see other people's side of
things more since nothing is black and white, though i can lose
patience with people who like to employ logical fallacies in their
point making."

laugh, so maybe that too .... don't worry not a bad thing, i just
laugh pretty freely. beyond those more physical traits, i think
people tend to notice i'm very comfortable talking - talking to
people, in front of people - generally just engaging in a

wearing them since i was a freshman in high school, and they don't
even register when i look in the mirror at this point. however,
they do tend to inspire comments from strangers. the most common
being, ""are those prescription?"" yes. yes they are. they are, in
fact, my prescription. they are also vintage and not a

texas. apparently i lost an accent along the way, 'cause i hear it

always interesting.<br />

but, the one thing people always remember is my warmth, nurturing
nature, and my creativity. everyone tells me how it is so nice to
be around me because i am always in a good mood. that's because

out of my sight. but when i turn around to try to catch a glimpse,
they all disappear."

techie type. you guys aren't lying when you say you like
intelligence. you also seem to like miniskirts.<br />
i've been told that this profile is intense, and i consider myself
to be a pretty intense person, but in real life i must have one
seriously good poker face, because the people who know me well

"besides what you can see in the photos, i can be intense because
i'm an introvert by nature and focus completely when meeting new

of energy to devote to friends instead of feeling worn out after
debating software features with coworkers who i would never chose
as friends."

butt. sometimes it's my curly hair, if it's behaving that day. and

literature, art and science outnumbering references to pop culture;
sense of humor (i.e. likes me, thinks i'm funny); carries a book

after they meet me, so i have no idea what they noticed. i'd like
to think it's my rugged good looks or amazing personality, who
knows though? there are so many things to like, it's crazy to pick
only a few. they also probably notice the qualities that would

my eyes?
that i am very honest and say what's on my mind.
"my sense of humor is droll. before you notice it, though, you'll
probably be confused by the wryness with which i deliver
one-liners. don't worry, though, something suddenly clicks around
the six-month mark."
"i'm a little shy and introverted around most people, but there are
some people that bring out my more outgoing side, which is often
larger than life. when polite conversation happens to touch on
something i'm passionate about...i transform."

the supermarket notice first..."

reference, greek."

me when we meet in person!"
i have no idea. maybe my asian eyes.

the homeless guy standing in front of walgreens that compliments
all the guests always calls me ""two-tone"". i figure it's the hair.
sometimes he calls me ""boots""."
i usually get a strange look and asked for identification.

on what i'm wearing and the light."

ross from friends"" a lot but that seems to have luckily ran its
course."

i have no idea. i am of the people persuasion?

bubbly personality. i on the other hand am as yet unconvinced my
personality is bubbly)"

would be physical, so....i'm not quite sure :)"

sense of humor and sarcastic silliness."

crying, like a sad clown. who can't make balloon animals and is
allergic to clown makeup. also this clown has bad credit and is not

i am interested in what okcupid says i am like (in the similar uses
section there's a note that says more adventurous or attentive or
whatever). i haven't figured out how to see these for myself, so
feel free to let me know what it thinks of me. i also like checking

drunk, it might be that i'm speaking in an accent for no apparent
reason. randomly walking down the street or on the bus it might be
me silently singing along to whatever is on my ipod. if they see me
getting tea it is likely the copious amount of honey i put into the
tea."

i can only really guess. at a glance i think people notice that i
am female, short, and maybe dressed a little bit different.<br />
upon interacting, well... i think i make it pretty quickly evident
that i am a bit of a nerd, and just sort of odd. i am not into

chicken noodle soup (very inconvenient!), or that i have an almost
entirely invisible spleen."

"i'm polite? i'm sarcastic? i have big eyes? do people notice those
things? i don't know. perhaps."

apparently, right down to the heels she wears.<br />
if you don't: that i'm wearing uncomfortably small
high-heeled<br />

in all seriousness, probably that i exude jewishness like a strong
musk. a bagel and lox musk. the analogy got away from me.<br />
if i have my shirt off people tend to notice my abs, which through
some genetic fluke have turned out pretty swell."

wall on my droid phone, the women behind me asked if i cut in front

she thought i cut in the line."

a conversation with the man in the tollbooth, woman at the dry

by the way, i'm judging you really hard right now if on your
profile, you've listed that the first things people notice about is
your smile, eyes, or height. surely, you're more creative than
that? i will make fun of you for the entire first date. although, i
may be too distracted to make fun of you because i could be too
fixated on your sexy tall stature, your beautiful eyes, or your
heavenly smile."
"i can be quite sarcastic and saucy but am really a pretty nice
dude."
i have uncontainable hair :)
"i would like to think that i tend to stand out in a crowd, for
better or worse. i've been told that i'm quite blunt when it comes
to opinion and matters of taste. this has a 50/50 effect on your
first impression of me. you either think i'm a total jerk, or you
wait for the conversation to progress and find i have my redeeming
qualities as well as my opinions."
i'm brown y'all
"that i have a friendly, approachable demeanor, i smile and laugh a
lot, hmm.... not sure what else. if we meet maybe you can tell me."

friend #3: ""your t-shirt (maybe i was nipping out?)<br />
there you have it!"
"...are my dashing good looks, winning personality, and stunning
depth. that's what i hear, anyhow."
are my eyes i guess.
"a little bit short, a lotta charisma"
"people always think i look like someone. i get sean penn a lot. i
actually ran into sean penn in a bar in my neighborhood once and
had no idea it was him. he had on a trucker hat and it looked
pretty stupid. i was drunk so i decided it would be a good idea to
say, ""nice trucker hat, asshole."" to sean penn. luckily, he laughed
instead of breaking a chair over my head."

oh, i recently got glasses, and wear them about half the time.
maybe they notice that. yeah probably, they're right on my face."
"mmmm, please tell me. i don't know. i tend to wear my dodgers and
angels hats sometimes so people are quick to point that out here in
sf ........and throw things at me."

"seems wherever i go in the world people always stop and ask for
directions. after years of this i finally asked a lady why me of
all the passers by. this was nyc so plenty to choose from. answer:

my height and good looks.
"after talking for a short while, i'm going to say my sarcasm. i
grew up with it and don't know how to communicate with people that
don't understand it.<br />
also, i tend to be either really quiet or really overtly sexual and
flirtatious upon meeting people. i realize these are polar
opposites."

that i'm quite shy until they get to know me, then quite the
opposite."

spontaneity, or the curiosity in my eyes."

most people think i'm older than i acualy am
i used to get eyes a lot.
"i get carded alot at restaurants and casinos because people don't
believe that i am older than 21, gets a little annoying at times,
but i try to take it as a compliment."
my hello kitty sippy cup.
"my humps and lovely lady lumps<br />
<br />
i change my okc profile a lot. i do crazy things with my hair. i
have a bunch of piercings in my head and a big tattoo and an
impressive rack.<br />
<br />
i am full of fidgeting - always moving, dancing, picking at my
fingers, pulling my hair. it will either drive you nuts of you'll
find it cute."
i don't know. why don't you tell me?
"that's a good question... occasionally people notice that i have a
small freckle on my bottom lip, but they usually think it's ink or
pepper depending on the situation."
""
"i look more serious than i am, i promise. i'm layered and i mean
that superficially i wear a lot of layers. and i'm horrible at
remembering names! it's such a curse..."
"hair, eyes, smile, tits..."
"how much i look like lintz. that i look nothing like lintz. that i
am the center of the universe. that i am completely insignificant.
my huge gut, my giant ears, my bald scraggly head, the wad of cash
i'm throwing in their face, the toilet paper stuck to the bottom of
my shoe, my huge zit, the fact that i'm picking my nose, my huge
nose, the huge zit on my huge nose, my one good eye, my bionic
cornea, the cockatoo on my shoulder, my boyish good looks, my sky
blue eyes, my arrogance, my ping pong paddle, my pigtails, nothing,
i have no idea.<br />

my slanted eyes that contrast the sky.
go back to question number 1... lol ;)

my upbeat attitude and positive outlook about life."

down a flight of stairs.it seems to be an attention getter."
my hoop earrings. they give me lot's of attitude.
""
i think that people usually notice me as i start to talk.
you tell me. many different interpretations.
"that i always look very serious and need to smile more. that is why
i'm trying to smile more. i might appear to be very serious and
looking mean, but i'm actually very easy going and able to laugh
very easily."
you tell me.
""
"maybe skewed perspective, aquilinity?"
"most people notice the long hair, <a class=""ilink"" href=

they're usually surprised on how approachable and laid back i am."
""
""
"smart, competent, strong (sometimes a little too much so), and a
little weirdness are the things people generally see in me. i used
to be described as aloof and stand-offish - now i'm often told that
i am social and friendly (personal growth!).<br />
apparently i look like a vegetarian lesbian (although this seems to
be increasing in strength, people are starting to think i'm vegan).
i eat meat and date guys though. but people have been assuming this
since i was 12, so apparently thats what i look like."
my voice. it's kinda scratchy. =)
"my humor. i have to be comfortable, but it's there."
"is that i have a very shapely...brain. just kidding, its my
smile.<br />

i may be online, but i don't im. (email me because i am doing too
many things at once as it is. :))"

be a real gent for chivalry is not dead just yet."
"i think people notice that i am very friendly. also, i am regularly
made fun by my coworkers for singing under my breath."
"no one has ever really told he they notice anything about me. don't
know if that really sad or really great. a homeless man did once
tell me i had amazing hair. i like to laugh. alot. humour is huge
for me, sarcasm is great too<br />

well i have been called a legend by a shit load of irish people,

have learned to keep it quiet. but you can hear me over the crowd.

noise).<br />

my sense of humor seems to be pretty universal, albeit dark and
sarcastic.<br />

noticed that beneath the veneer of my toughness, i can be very
emotional."
"my hair! i finally found a hairstyle i love to rock and it consists
of short on one side and long on the other. i guess i couldnt

many people at first glance but i do think of myself as
approachable enough that i'm worth a few minutes of your time."
... i'm kinda tall.
"someone once told me when they first met me they thought i should
be wearing a smoking jacket...take that as you may..."

"i have a huge smile and laugh often  because i'm usually clowning
around with a big group of people.<br />

i am a very positive &amp; high-energy person. one of my favorite
quotes is that if you <em>catch fire with enthusiasm, people will
come for miles to watch you burn</em>  why live any other way?"
"i'm still trying to figure out what to put here. maybe you can help
me?"

"i been told i can make an enterance...rather stand out or stand
aside than being part of a pack..."
"my hair is never longer than a quarter of an inch.<br />

apparently i look racially ambiguous. i get a lot of questions
along the lines of ""where are you from, originally?"" when i say
""new york city,"" they say, ""no, before that... where are your
people from?"" or, ""wait, what are you?"" uh, human? oh well.
sometimes i'm sorely tempted to be a smart-ass, but my
brain-to-mouth filter is usually pretty strong unless i'm drunk or
with close friends."
"id have to say that its my missing limbs. after that my eyes. fyi.
i use a wheelchair but can also walk so dont let my little handicap
deter you"
"not sure, but apparently i haven't changed much... i was recognized
on the street by a classmate from preschool. i wouldn't have
believed it, except that they got the school right and remembered i
only ever wore cowboy boots or sandals. i kind of wish i still had
those cowboy boots..."

what do you notice about me?
my height? french accent? hopefully not something worse...
"my height, my size and my blue eyes."
"not really sure, i think more often than not i tend to go
unnoticed. but if i had to choose something i would say my hair."
"that i look like jackie chan. or jet li. or kim jong il. or any
other asian celebrity out there."
"i don't know, how about you tell me?"
"usually my smile, but lately my eyelashes (weird)"
"from a physical perspective it's usually my eyes, smile or my
voice. on a personal level it's usually my shyness or sensitivity
to emotional situations."
""
""
they don't. i am a master of camouflage.
"that i'm tall, pierced, tattooed and have said something horribly
offensive."
"that i haven't uploaded many photos.<br />

"hmmm, must be that je ne sais quoi"
""
"??eyes, but everyone says that.., lots of facial expressions??"
"my brazilian accent, my beard. well, i just shaved, it will take a
while to grow the beard back."
"that, my friends, is a hell of a good question!<br />
<br />
seriously. one of my biggest problems in trying to get to know
people is that i never know what they think about me until they
actually go and tell me. which is not usually their conversation
starter, unless i've somehow managed to royally piss them off or
something. it's not that i can't read people, i usually have a
reasonably decent idea of what they think about each other: ""those
two are a couple"", ""that guy is creeping out the kids"", ""lady looks
like she wants to talk"". but make me one of the parties interacting
and i just draw a blank.<br />
<br />
so, anyways, would you be so kind as to ignore social conventions
about reserving your opinions and tell me? pretty please?<br />
<br />
edited (june 2010): ok, it seems we have a winner. it's now been 3
times in the last couple weeks that people upon first seeing me say
something about my hair. i've just uploaded an itsy bitsy old photo

one i'll be uploading it here, so you can see and judge by yourself

stiff"" i would agree with that definition.<br />
<br />
a nice guy - a lot of people say that. friendly, generous,
colorful, weird, wise, talented. many people call me talented even
though my definition of ""talent"" is enjoying the process so much
you learn to do it well and practice enough to get past beginner
mistakes. i've had decades of not leaving my room to practice
writing and drawing, plus the pleasure of studying these arts
online and offline with various masters. of course i'm good at
them. i also believe anyone who wanted to could be even if they
overcome disabilities to do it.<br />

i am a cheerful optimist with a realistic view of the world's
perils. i look at the best case and the worst case knowing that
reality will usually throw me something in between. sometimes
something good comes out better than i ever hoped and that's always

"depends on the person. i'm dryly sarcastic, but not a cynic. this
can lead some people to be offended by something inappropriate i've
said, but actually meant in a cute way. i find that this reaction
conveniently filters out uptight, slow witted and generally
humorless folk. this hopefully doesn't make me a dick and perhaps
only slightly dickish, which in this overly sensitive city infested
with delicately rounded sensibilities, is a badge that i'm proud to
wear.<br />

hair and i am always wearing glasses. they've become a part of my
identity, i guess. when i roam free sans corrective lenses, i look
like a different person. it's also possible that people notice my
nose piercings. both sides are pierced and i have three tiny rings
in my septum. it makes my asymmetrical nose appear perfectly
balanced, although some people ask if my nostril piercings are
connected through the cartilage of my nose. i've started wondering
why i didn't just do that..."
i have no idea... weird question.
that i'm a good kisser.

why don't you tell me? ;)
i would have to say my eyes
"my eyes, smile, attentiveness &amp; perhaps my limbic field (our
limbic system being how our body's feels ourself and those
connected nearby). some people like my forearms, some like my hair,
some like my hugs, my stocky strong confidence, and for some i'm a
safe cozy snuggle bear and/or good loving dog. i'm quiet,
personally attentive, smartly aware, busy, and diversified, but
make time for play, learning, community, conversation, and enjoy a
provencal siesta now &amp; then."
the dimples haunt me like a ghost from my childhood.
"my retracted nature which is sometimes confused by shyness but is
not completely true. my intelligence is also something people
usually compliment me on (though i don't think i'm that smart
either, so don't think i'm boasting), as well as my friendliness.
physically, people notice my height and my weight (kinda slim i
admit). some say i look refined and elegant."
you tell me
"i'm dead serious about my humor. laughing should be a sport. while
i love discussing world issues, i love the sound, feel and
sincerity of laughter. my humor can be sarcastic, and i believe
there is no better music to my ears than well-played humor.<br />

maybe it's my irresistible charm... or something like that."

try harder), i have blue eyes and that i don't have black hair."

honestly, i am told my jawline and smile stand out.<br />
some people, lucky enough to see it, have complimented me on my
build.<br />
also, note that these days i am rocking a short beard."
"my eyes? my dimples? that i have good energy. that i like typing in
all lower case. lately, the beard. which, does not define me, i
define it. while it is present currently, it isn't always. i've
been getting a lot of compliments on it from guys and girls alike,
so i'm rolling with it for now. guys seem to be jealous of it, and
even women who aren't beard lovers have given it high marks. that,
and with all the work lately, i've just been too lazy to do
anything with it, such as shave."

nice attitude and my eyes."

people focus upon. given that caveat, i suppose most women notice i
am not small."

not sure i even want to know."

my shoulder or a large heavy ear ring or maybe that i'm wearing
black unless at a faerie gathering or pride parade. that my black
boots shine like a mirror. maybe they notice i'm not wearing

be honest, it's an obsession that rivals mine for gay porn."

that takes more than a look to notice. seriously though, most
people notice that i'm quiet. i often will not say much of anything

better i know someone, the easier it is to talk. i find small talk

<br />
gabrielle:<br />
renee is genuine. she will uplift you with her great sense of
humor, and tickle you with her contagious laughter. her wit and
magnetism make her a real a show stealer where ever she goes. she
also has a way of disarmingly getting into your core and really
knowing you in a way that makes you feel very loved and understood.
i think the thing i like best about renee is that her ability to
show affection and compassion is limitless. she's also really good
at math which comes in handy.<br />
<br />
randy:<br />
renee is sexy, funny, fun, smart, kind,loyal, and an original. i
often have tears of laughter streaming down my face and my sides
are hurting after hearing one of renee's adventures. after knowing
renee for just a short time i told my husband if something should
happen to me, he should marry renee. if you are lucky enough to
hang out with renee and become a part of her life, then you will
see for yourself what a catch she is. we have been friends for over
10 years and i am a big fan<br />
<br />
andrea:<br />
renee reminds me a bit of my husband that i have been with for 15
years. my marriage works because i finally realized that what makes
a good partner is someone who is kind. renee is 1 of the kindest
people i know- she doesn't have a mean bone in her body. she is a
loyal and dedicated friend who shows up for the people she cares
about. she's hilarious- she's a comedienne! she takes great care of
herself and is hot! she will go to any fun artsy cool event at any
time and is a great sport."

"wait, why are you asking me? you should be asking the people doing

i just met you.<br />

this is crazy.<br />
<br />
but here's my number.<br />

it has darkened up a bit, i still have some reddish highlights."

"people tend to hear me before they see me, so i guess my loud
voice? i also tend to get mistaken for a woman often, i don't know
why waiters and cashiers always call me ma'am or miss... i think i
would make an ugly woman!"
"the photo on my bank card. it almost guarantees a friendly
exchange..."

hip i cut it last year. i have regretted it ever since and can't
wait until it's long again."
"i sometimes have really enthusiastic way to speak and use my voice.
sometimes i move my hands a lot when i talk, which amuses many
people. i guess sometimes i enjoy being in the centre of attention,
but i know when to avoid it. :)<br />
last girl i dated in finland said i'm a quite distant person in the
sense that i give people very much personal space. occasionally she
didn't like it, so i've changed in that sense a bit. but she was
finnish anyway."
is that i look nothing like forest whitaker.
"i am either smiling a lot or staring. lol! i love to people watch
and looking at all the interesting people passing by is amusing."
i'm very well-spoken.

you can tell me?"
my laugh.
i like to have a good time
my baby blues
my size and then my smile.
"most likely that i am smiling and singing along to whatever music
is currently playing."
probably my long hair and my eyes.
my overwhelming modesty...and sarcasm...
"on first glance, that i'm white and nerdy with glasses. but i
suppose the other thing would be how open i am about myself."

"within about five minutes of meeting and greeting a new person, one
of three attributes will generally be noticed:<br />
<br />
1. geek - depending on the conversation topic i have the tendency
to ""dork"" myself. or, you'll notice the think geek t-shirt i'm
wearing (50/50... maybe 60/40 if we're at a casual bar).<br />
<br />
2. intelligence - while my knowledge of 12th century french fashion
is quite limited, my aforementioned ""book smarts"" are
prevalent.<br />
<br />
3. conversationalist - regardless of topic, i can always hold (and
rather enjoy) a good conversation."

walked in the room, tori looked at me and said, ""hey! i know
you!""<br />

i said, ""really? you remember me?""<br />

she said, ""of course, i remember the sparkle in your eyes...""<br />

--i have a witness this actually happened!"
"probably my smile. i've been told i smile with my whole face. and
then it's probably my eyes - which change color and do not always
agree on which color to be."
""
"i think they notice my glasses and my very thick hair. and<br />
hopefully my smile. :)"
""
"well, depending on my mood, it could be a maniacal grin, or a
sleepy yawn. if i'm moving, they might notice my tendency to trip -
i'm massively uncoordinated, which is why i stick to sports that
don't involve a lot of eye-hand coordination - or at least, i don't
feel too bad about the suckage that occurs when i'm on a <a class=

<br />
most people, unless they sneak up from behind me while i'm talking
to friends, probably notice that i'm abnormally quiet. as soon as i
get to know them, though, they forget that i was ever quiet! i have
a tendency to be direct (and, i'm told, a bit cutting) in my
general conversation with people i know. i like to <a class=""ilink""

my intense manliness. ok that's a lie.
"joyful and energetic, loud and rambunctious, and argumentative (it
comes from a good place).<br />

mid-west education in good naturedness followed by the tenderness

collection of them)."

him."

my single dimple...what's up with that?
my eyes.

eagerness to help/hold doors/take pictures for tourists trying to

"i polled around a random group of friends and came up with the
following list:<br />

- ""you're well spoken""<br />
- ""your eyelashes""<br />
- ""hair. definitely the hair.""<br />
- ""tan and lips. you're a morsel of hot latina lovin'.""<br />

answers went downhill from there. if you want to know what you
first notice about me, let's grab a drink. you can decide if my
friends were correct."
my great looks and personality.
"i'm easy going, approachable and try to set people at ease."
"most say i am charming, and i have a great smile."
quiet i am.
""
"i guess my eyes. but aside from that...i have about 6 different
laughs. apparently i tilt my head to the left when i'm listening
intently. i stop to pet strangers' dogs (sometimes not the best
idea)."
this smiley bish...
""
"most people used to notice my hair (i just cut it-check old pics),
my personality, and later my nice abs and big _________ ;)<br />
<br />
oh yeah, a lot people tell me i'm act mature for my age."

"my laugh, smile, eyes &amp; shoes"
my dark hair and mysterious dark eyes.

appearance and outward personality-- to the character simon tam
from ""firefly"". if you are a <a class=""ilink"" href=

once when i was feeling really lazy at halloween i dressed as simon
simply by putting on a vest; everybody got it.<br />
<br />
i have a large and slightly archaic vocabulary and am prone to
saying things like ""inchoate"" and ""brummagem"" in conversation. i
talk fairly quickly and with lots of hand gestures. when thinking
hard i pace in circles."
"i was time magazines person of the year in 2006 but i dont like to
brag about it"
tall and friendly.
"that i'm really, really enthusiastic and smile a lot.<br />
<br />
i'm wearing a costume.<br />
<br />
i had to wear an eye patch on and for a few months because of a
necessary surgery and it was certainly an attention grabber. i'm
fairly confident that i was able to make the eye-patch sexy."
"what, you want me to give away the big secret about what's obvious
about me?"
my smile :)
""
my eyes
my beard. or my sarcastic sense of humor.

accent."
hmm.. maybe my eyes... they tend to be a mix of several colors.
""
"hard to say, i haven't really asked.<br />
maybe that i look younger than i am (thanks family genes).<br />
my facial expressions, which can be both entertaining and
perplexing. (please, don't attempt to interpret them, just ask me)."

people admit to noticing about me right away. and then of course my
sunny disposition :)"
my randomness
probably my height

been told i have a nice complexion."
"that i won't tell them what my tat says, and that i'll lie to them
about it (repeatedly) if they keep asking. and that, contrary to
what i've just said, i'm not actually a competitive sandcastle
builder who specializes in turrets and moats."
"my height, and that i'm very friendly and outgoing, and always
smiling."
"hmm... good question, i'll be sure to ask the next person i see"
my smile
""
"i hate to say only physical aspects but that's mostly what people
examine the first time they see someone.. so definitely my hair
which i really don't like people touching lol. next is probably the
speed at which i walk.. i don't like waiting at cross walks so it's
a constant battle to keep up with that little white man. i would
love to throw in some aspect of my stellar personality but the
truth is i'm a little on the quieter side when first meeting
people."
"hmmm...it's usually been my smile.<br />
but at times from afar my colored clothing may catch the eye of
others.<br />
once they hear me talk?? generally, people like to chat with me,
particularly over coffee after a long day. [ps some say i may be a
little loud...voice carries...]"

smile due to the naturally perfectly straight teeth (according to
my dentist),"

maybe my height (low) or my laugh (frequent).<br />
they usually don't notice my charming tooth gap - at first."
it might depend on the minute of the week...
""
"my warm personality, friendly demeanor, and height."
"people usually pick up my voice that booms a bit too much, my hands
that never stop moving and my eyes that get so big until i smile.
when i smile, i squint so hard that they are completely hidden.
honestly, it makes me look like an anime character."
""
is that i'm hilarious.

contagiously big laugh
i am short
my eyes

i was nicknamed doogie for years due to: 1. my nerdiness. 2. my
striking resemblance to neal patrick harris. (back then at least)"
my seven mile smile.
that i am a happy person.

years before the magazine editorials."
"i'm relatively tall, dimples, big brown eyes and constantly
cracking jokes.<br />

'chapelle's show'<br />
'eddie izzard' ,<br />
'mitch hedberg'<br />
russell peters,<br />

"probably my glasses. if i'm lucky, a cool pair of shoes i've got
on."
"i am a little on the reserved side when meeting new people. but
they notice that i am friendly and easy going."
"i seem to get complimented on my earrings a lot, so i suppose
people are looking at my ears? seems strange, but who am i to
judge? i wear a gwar hoodie almost every day and people tend to
comment on that as well."
"when my hair gets long, my hebro. (now it's beyond hebro to
slash-esque). otherwise, my dashing good looks, and probably after
a few minutes, my ability to ask the tough questions."
i've been told i have a nice butt.
""
my smile.
i guess my eyes? weird question for me to answer.
"maybe my height (i'm 6-1) then if they get a little closer they'll
notice that my eyes change color. brown to hazel to green back to
brown... i know it sounds crazy but they really do."

out...could be a lot of things."

"i have red hair. yes i know it's red. it's been there for a while.
since birth in fact. why are you still pointing this out."
"i have really white teeth. i think it's genetic (from dad,
definitely not mom). it's also readily apparent since i smile a
lot. other than that, i receive a lot of compliments on my
eyeglasses. i would rather receive compliments on my face, but i
shouldn't be too fussy. after all, the eyeglasses are pretty nice."
"is that i love to talk, loudly at times, and that i'm half persian.
sports usually will come up in casual conversations with me."
"quiet at first, but complete opposite when you get to know me."
my...beard?

oh, and my stupid okcupid profile name on here. i should have just

i'm really blond and have really blue eyes.

about.."

blend in but i dont really ?"

etc.
i am almost always smiling
"glasses? no, swagger."
"believe it or not, because of the blue eyes and red hair, i've been
asked more times that i care to think about if i'm irish. but those
are the two things that people notice about me first."
"i'm skinny and lanky. i slouch. i wear ultimate jerseys or
baseball-related clothing."
"my smile, my laughing eyes, and my long blond hair!"
my graceful fall as i trip over a crack in the sidewalk.
i don't know? you tell me.
"for some reason, my hair gets attention - it sometimes has an
elvis-esque curl :)"
"i tend to be quiet. listening is one of my strong suits, especially
conversations of others. dialogues, interactions and ways people
communicate in groups and zones of comfort.<br />
<br />
jokes and jokes and jokes and jokes, a joker describes me well."
people tell me i have a nice smile
"i can be pretty distractible in conversation and take forever to
tell stories because i tend to get caught up in a million tangents
and then forget what i was talking about in the first place. i also
enjoy some good sarcastic teasing."

i'm pretty petite.
my kind smile ( i hope)
my baby blues

<br />
&lt; 15 feet: i'm long and thin.<br />
<br />
&lt; 5 feet: i have eyes you could lose yourself in for hours."
i like to laugh.
"is that i'm not afraid to say something and that i'm quite
opinionated."
"i start off kind of quiet because sometimes people don't get my
sense of humor, but those that do get my sense of humor usually
find me pretty funny. or so they tell me. they also usually notice
that i'm more into sports than girls usually are. i have my
favorite teams and i actually know stuff about them."
""
my dimples. or maybe that i have unusual earrings.
""
"well i get really bored with my hair.. i have a blonde streak, a
feather, a dread lock, and one half of my head shaved with a
design.<br />
it sounds funny when i type it out like that. (:<br />
i think my tattoos are next, unless you can't see any of them and

tall and blond

my big frame and big smile.
""
"my shoes, oddly enough. i tend to get comments on my clothes too."
"my latin charms... haha jk. some people tell me that i have
nice<br />

usually like my sense of humor, or, you tell me."

nice person which i am
"personality, presence, hair, intuition, passion, self motivation,
great work ethic, smile."

wellspoken and trustworthy.
i don't know.
i have no idea haha
my massive intellect and my wonderful sense of rhythm.
"people usually notice my eyes and my smile. i laugh and smile a
lot. i'm a firm believer in the idea that we contribute to and
significantly determine our own level of happiness, so next time
you are feeling down try putting a smile on your face. believe it
or not, it is really hard not to feel good when people smile back
at you."
"the first thing people usually notice about me are my warmness and
sense of humor."
""
"if it isn't my sparkling personality, it's definitely my bright red
hair. also probably my tattoos. i have a decent amount of them. a
kid once complimented them and called them ""stamps"". that will
always stick with me. it was kind of adorable."
ask people :)
"when i was teaching, people often told me i looked young for a
professor. lately, folks aren't as forthcoming.<br />

they do mention my height sometimes. i'm tall, or at least i really
am as tall as i claim to be on here, not like that weirdo guy who
thinks he's 6' but is really 5'7"" on a good day. jeez, who are
these people?(!)"
my super bad ass ear rings.
i seriously have no idea.

my humbling modesty and extraordinary sense of humor. honestly
though, i'm not terribly fond of talking about myself."

nice? polite? i don't know. i can't read minds :)

told my smile and hugs."
"my sparkling blue eyes and downy, golden locks."
that i got my swagger back
""

question must be to find out what the questionee wants people to
notice about them. for me, this is:)<br />
<br />
that i am a genius."
my face is perfectly symmetrical
"well, there's the tall thing, and the long hair thing and the not
your average sorta boy thing.... it often gets confused for
eurotrash.... which is kinda funny."
"blue eyes, curvy bod, loud laugh, big smile."

adorable."

awesome hair cut!"

smile and a slightly sarcastic but wonderful sense of humor"

i've got great hair. its true.
my smile and my energy.
lemme ask!
"i have long-ish hair, i'm tall-ish (for a woman), i crack jokes to
break the silence. usually terrible jokes with horrific puns... ask
me about the time a frog walked into a bank."
"my personality. my reputation usually precedes me. i'm good natured
and funny and my friends love introducing me to their friends. i'm
fun to be around and am pretty much the captain of the fun police."
"probably my laugh, or the way my shoulders bob when i'm laughing."
i honestly don't know or care
i laugh easily and have a crazy contagious laugh.

what i hear the most is comments on my height. then i hear, ""has
anyone ever told you that you look like (insert that dude from the
notebook here),"" which is funny to me because i don't see it at all
and i'm pretty sure he isn't six foot three inches tall."
shaved head probably?

wearing awesome shoes? that my hair is asymmetrical? that i am very
sensitive? that i have an accent? not sure."

waistline. my glasses make my eyes about twice as big."

true.)"
"personality, smile, genuine"
i suppose that i am tall

often told me i was ""weird."" but after moving to sf, i almost never
hear that. ah, san francisco!"
i look like keanu reeves
"i get ""smile!"" a lot. apparently what i think is my neutral ""i'm

sure how to fix this without grinning idiotically at all times."

that follows me around everywhere."
i am a smart-ass.
don't know...

that can lull babies to sleep and lure grannies to moonwalk. i
can't help it ... it's just who i am.<br />

i have no clue ... i've heard it all. the latest was from some
random dude on the street who had to be high (what he said was the
kindest statement i've heard in years, btw). so based on this
highly credible source, i'd venture to declare that anything i say

me - is completely reliable and definitely true."

which is nice, because i make it myself!<br />
people also notice i have an east coast accent; i was born in
massachusetts, and even though i moved to california in the third
grade, a bit of the boston drawl was imprinted on my developing
brain..and i talk with my hands, and say what i mean, which
apparently is not so californian..<br />

"i'm a 27 year old guy with a ducktales t-shirt? there's a good
chance the answer to this depends on the time of year in which the
question is asked. in the winter, it's probably ""why the hell is he
wearing shorts?"" why? because in the middle of winter every
building decides the heat needs to be jacked up to 78 degrees,
which might as well be a sauna when i'm dressed for winter.<br />
<br />
actually, i wish i could wear shorts to work. or sweatpants,
depending on the day. i'm not ashamed to admit that. i don't know
why we invented formal clothes. it's idiotic."

my smooth round shaved head and that i have some extra pounds.
"my friends say they can locate me in a room, just by my laugh.

also, when i first meet someone the third or fourth question tends
to be, ""where are you from?"", referencing my ethnic background."

people..i cherish a great conversation"

and smile. as for aspects that don't require tangablity, people
usually notice my personality."

people are later surprised to learn i have a morbid sense of humor.
i want monty python's dead parrot sketch read at my funeral."
"that is a good question. i will have to start taking a poll while
on muni"
"glasses, eyes, ...uh... sometimes my accent comes out, especially
if beer is involved."
"this one varies a lot. a few people thinks that i am brilliant in
just a few minutes, and i have yet to figure out what exactly gave
them this impression. others quickly jumps to conclusion that i am

"to quote arsenio hall: i'm large and in charge. i tend to be
""directive"" and will dominate a room if i'm even vaguely near my
comfort zone [not to imply dominance in the bedroom - that's not
actually my thing]. and as my photos make obvious, i am big, plus
sized, fat, zaftig, ... it's cool if that's not your thing, but
let's avoid that awkward moment."
i'm pretty darn friendly and easy to humor.
you'd have to ask the people noticing me; whoever they may be.
"i get a lot of comments on my hair from strangers. i was told by an
ex that the honest first thing he noticed about me was my cleavage,
then of course my sparkling personality. i would think the first
thing a new person would notice is that i'm a nervous talker."
you tell me...
"i never generalize nor speak in absolutes. ever.<br />
enlarged to show texture.<br />
i'm on a horse."
"i'm really inquisitive, i'm outstandingly bald, and sometimes i
have this ""serious face"", which fools people into thinking i mean
business or something.<br />
<br />
i walk with a slight limp, which comes from a mild case of cerebral
palsy. i love it, because it scares away shallow people, and it's a
great reminder that i'm happy with who i am."
"probably my hair. first because it was long and unwieldy and
vaguely a jewfro, then because it was much shorter than before. and
now, after about 10 minutes of talking to me, they're like ""wait,
is your hair purple""? so i suppose it's not the first thing they
notice anymore.<br />
<br />
i was once quoted as saying ""if you need a complete lack of
subtlety, just let me know"". it's not that i can't be subtle, it's
just that i prefer to be brutally honest when i think i can get
away with it."
my very european dress sense
"my easy smile and distinctive laugh. most say it's infectious, some
say it's ditsy."
why would i wreck the surprise for you?
"my accent. many people think i'm from boston. i am not. i moved to
the states when i was a young teen, my accent is slowly catching up
to my body."

tend to comment on my eyes."

update: i think people look up from where they're standing if they
hear me in conversation, wander over to get closer, and think ""who

lots of energy...

tendency to find the hilarity in the littlest things."

little dark and the other is full, whole-hearted, and completely
contagious. john is someone you want on your team, whether in a
math contest (he can pull out the right answer before you can say
boo), on hikes (where he brings extra water in case someone else
forgets), during life changes (he is a tireless supporter and
cheerleader), or during emergencies (he once stayed in the
emergency room with me for 5 hours just because)."

to say its my smile or some other random thing :)"
i am smiling and having a good time.

guessing... i seem like a nice guy, maybe the nice guy from next
door... i have a good smile &amp; nice eyes... once in a while i
get compared to a sports person (i have actually been told this)

it's my understanding that this is highly contextual.
uh.. i have redish blond hair (not irish) ok.
"depend highly on context, but most often it's my sense of humor."
i'm told my eyes
"i am super friendly and approachable. i am a little dorky and
intellectual. i wear suits a lot."
"my curly hair or they think i look familiar. not sure why i look
familiar but i am learning to go with it. sometimes it gets me free
drinks. and no, i didn't work at aaa. that is the last place
someone thought they remembered me from."

"you'll definitely have to ask other people what the first thing
they notice about me is -- how would i know? ;) i'd like to think
the first thing they notice is how easy i am to talk to; people
often feel comfortable opening up to me right away. if that's not
the first thing they notice, then maybe my big eyes?"
"last summer my friends threw a surprise party in my honor and asked
people to come dressed up as me. all the girls came in short
skirts, fuzzy boots, and striped arm warmers. i had already
complimented at least five girls on how adorable they looked before
i learned that they were imitating me. terribly embarrassing. but i
guess that's what people notice about me..."

<br />
my eyes. windows to my soul. la de dah"
blue eyes and longish hair.
you tell me! :-p
"i wish i knew. i am actually paranoid about making good first
impressions. they probably notice that i'm easily excitable and
talkative. i worry that people think i'm too into weird things (see
academy awards and airports, above, along with long-form
television)."
"my red hair. it comes from my grandmother's side of the family. if
someone stares at it too long, i distract them with the
phenomenally white underside of my forearm."
"the first thing anyone notices about me is my amazing collection of
t-shirts--they all have funny sayings or designs on them ""i'd love
to have a battle of wits with you, but you appear unarmed"" is
probably my favorite; another good one is ""sometimes i wonder why
that frisbee is getting bigger, and then it hits me.""<br />
<br />
beyond that, people probably notice that i'm pretty talkative,
followed quickly by the observation that i tend to be unafraid of
my vocabulary."
"my eyes? who the hell knows? this is a silly question, though,
isn't it? how should i know what people first notice about me. i'm
not them. i'm me."
"i have a fast working mind and sharp wit. sometimes the ny side
comes out a bit too early..."
my smile :d
"it seems like this question is more about how aware you are of what
other people think than what you know about yourself. people
probably think i'm quiet, maybe even a bit arrogant, though it's
really just because i am a little introverted and shy with new
people. physically it's probably that i'm short, haha."
"my shaved head, my smile, my tattoos (have 2, one on each arm) and
my pierced ear"
my eyes and dark beard.
depends on who's noticing
what have you observed so far?
"when they see me probably that i'm wearing glasses or something
superficial like that. when folks get to know me it becomes quickly
apparent that i keep it real... really real."
"i have a distinctive walk (and i'm actually working on it .. i mean
to get it more ergonomically correct) i guess. i talk to everyone,
and i can be very animated. but sometimes in new york, when i'm out
on my own, it makes more sense to pretend like i'm clint eastwood

down."

i stick out in conversations sometimes."

well, two out of those three."

selfless charm take a little more time to come through."

really difficult to find clothes, rental cars, or hotel beds. i've
also had a couple of people comment on my hazel eyes."

sleep!). i don't think new yorkers appreciated a stranger smiling
at them...i came to realize this after living there."

some say its that i am easy to talkt to after meeting me for just a
few minutes, and some say the first thing they notice is my
openness to talking to new people and approaching people i have
never met and striking up an enjoyable conversation. it just
depends on the situation i am in that determines what people

blue-ish colored freckle (a very odd word in print, i must say!) on
my right cheek."

around."

which is something i do take great care of. my energy is something
people notice immediately. i often am alone places and people will
approach me just to acknowledge my presence. its a quality i really
enjoy about myself."

after that, they usually see my blue eyes or my height. i am a
little over six feet tall."

not sure! let me know :d
"i'm a pretty outgoing person. oh and that i have a 3/4 sleeve on my
left arm. you can kinda see it in a few of my photos."
good things.
i'm still not sure how to answer this question.
"well i think obviously, people tend to notice they way one looks
right off that bat, that is to be assumed right? so physically i
would say my eyes...hopefully ;).<br />
in terms of personality perhaps my dry sense of humor."
i am usually at least a foot shorter than everyone else.
"i am blessed with the ability to reach your highest shelves and
change your most unreachable lightbulbs. (but not dunk your
basketballs, sadly.)"
i need to ask the next person i meet..

attentiveness."

"my shoes, or maybe the way i dress. while not really into mma or
being a juice head, i do wear affliction and similar shirts.
however i dislike symmetrical designs. my friends tend to 'tease'
me about this, and i don't have people coming up to me telling what
they first noticed about me, so..."

friends easily? or maybe my accent? ;) it's not a german accent
though."
"i sneeze a lot. but luckily i've been told i have a very dainty
sneeze."
"i think it depends on what kind of mood i'm in or what kind of
conversation we're having. in big groups i tend to stay lost in
thought and can be quite shy. when i'm a random stranger at a bar i
can be overwhelmingly outgoing and a completely different person."
"honestly, i think it's the nerd in me - but most people say i'm
smart right after meeting me. i was in the elevator at o'hare
recently, and a girl who had to be like 14-15 was with her mother
in the elevator with me. the daughter looks at me and says 'you
look like you're really smart.' of course she didn't know i just
took something to sleep for the flight and hadn't really slept in
the last 36 hours - i just appeared smart standing in the elevator
dressed like a yippie. no matter how 'hip' i try and be with
fashion decisions - i can't stray from the fact my old man had
homemade cutoff jeans where the pockets lining was longer than the
shorts - and he always had room for the costanza wallet and the
comb. (i'm never going bald! yay, brother got it..)"
""
people i don't know always tell me i look like this or that guy.
"i have really thick hair and i'm pretty easy to talk to. i love
meeting strangers and finding something great about them, but if
someone rubs me the wrong way, i don't hide it. i'm pretty jokey,
though sometimes to my detriment. some think i'm from the east
coast, as i can be a bit salty, but i'm from the bay area."
this is a loaded question
"hyperactive lol. sometimes i bounce off the walls and stuff. or at
least thats what some people try to tell me."
"assuming that i'm not wearing a costume or on fire, probably that i
am pretty tall, or that i have a beard. or that my girlfriend is
friggin' hot. maybe my sense of humor. it really depends on the
circumstances, i suppose."

kind and a very loyal and trustworthy friend for those important
people in my life."
"at first: blue eyes. long hair. cute smile.<br />
<br />
eventually: southern manners. mellow disposition. unconventional
outlook on life."
"my curly hair, and then my eyes"
no idea.
"my smile and special ability to make someone feel good about
whatever the situation."
would probably be the fact that i smile a lot.
"probably my eyes, i get complemented on them often. you tell me."
my distinctive fashion sense lol!
often my redish/brown hair or facial hair.
"besides the physical part (pretty eyes, hair, smile, etc), i love
hearing when people notice the energy in the room shift because i
make people feel comfortable and gravitate towards me. i think i
vibrate at a higher energy than some- probably why all kinds of
animals gravitate to me. even the human variety."

face. but then again i'll let you tell me ;)"

for hours if given the chance.<br />

also, there is a 10% chance you will tell me ""you look familiar""
when you meet me. my lost twin must have been on a hulu ad during
30 rock."

i like to laugh a lot and am outgoing
i'm tall :)

"sometimes i sound really canadian, otherwise my eyes"
people ask if i play in the nba...

my relaxed demeanor? that i look younger than i am? that i'm taller

why don't you tell me when we meet?"

guess?"
i'm a girl always with a smile :)
i'm tall.
my shaved bald head
my laugh and my voice.
"hmm, how could we possibly know the answer to this question? i can
maybe say what i think people might notice (people sometimes say i
have nice eyes) but we meet so many people who we never get to know
well enough to ask them this question, right? ok, i've just way
overanalyzed this. anyway, i guess i say my eyes."
"usually, that i have a celebrity doppelgnger."
""
"i'm very 'smiley' and friendly. while i still suspect people on the
muni are out to rob me (bad flashbacks from a short stint in
queens/brooklyn), i am generally optimistic about life. i'm
competitive about weird things (like board games and 2-block radius
mafia games), and like singing out loud even though i'm tone deaf.
you'll notice all of these things w/in the first five minutes of
meeting me."

my horrible good looks or the tattoo on my face.
"the crystal blue eyes are difficult to miss if you're catching me
from the front. if you're spotting me from behind, it's likely the
rear, dear. i've been led to believe i can be immodest about such

racist, is it?"

people who answer this are actually answering ""the first things

talk really fast while doing so (at times). people notice my
athleticism when outdoors."
hapa.
"i have a strange sense of humor, and i stand with my hands like a
squirrel/ mr. burns."
ive had a couple of nice comments about my eyes...
"my green eyes, my tattoos or that i don't have a thick boston
accent even though thats where i grew up."

are my energy and my smile. both are big.
probably my red hair and green eyes
almost everyone tells me how cool they think my name is..........
"i don't know, you'll have to tell me."
"i tend to always have a camera with, some notice my smile and
laugh. hipster nerd glasses, but they're for serious."
"i am told - my eyes, and of course, my height.<br />
i tend to talk with my hands when i get going, so be prepared for a
little contact conversation.<br />
my gentle humor will always try to break out early. for better or
worse, it has its own life sometimes and i can only hold it back so
long."
"my smile. very friendly, outgoing and easy to talk to. my new york
accent. athletic build. the ease in which people typically open up
to me. that i have a good and genuine heart. yes i know a lot to
""first"" notice about me. hey it's what i've been told. i prefer the
good heart, genuine and easy to talk to...."
"they notice how passionate, energetic and enthusiastic i am about
life, living, serving other people and constantly taking my life
higher and higher, making it hotter and hotter in every area
imaginable. they also notice that i spend my time appreciating
life, being present in the moment, almost like i am experiencing it
for the first time. life is too short not to live your life in
wonder and amazement!"
hmmmm...
"my black lab (yes, he's my guide dog), my ballerina-like posture,
my fabulous outfit, my hair."
eyes i would say but if we ever meet you tell me...
my inherent swarthiness. or my boots.
"i tend to overdress. unfortunately this gives a lot of women the
wrong idea about me just 'cause i'm not the typical straight guy."
babyface?
"im not really sure, my eyes are sort of bugged out"
my smile.

i would hope it's my smile!
black hair and deep voice
"other than my sassy wit and charm, definitely my blonde hair."

i wear glasses and i have been called tall before.
my salt and pepper hair... grecian formula fans beware!
i guess my glasses?
"i smell like old spice deodorant.<br />

i look like a child."
my eyes and my personality
my laugh...it's pretty loud and kind of contagious.
""
"i get a lot of comments on my hair -- sometimes it's a reasonable
length, sometimes it's more like a lion's mane. i just cut it, so
it's pretty normal-looking at the moment. the photos i have up here
are from 3 very different pablos."
"i'm not sure.<br />
maybe my smile."
"my potty mouth, or, a too smooth sales-y personality. it goes away
in 30 minutes... i have no idea why i come off this way since i'd
like to think i'm grounded in my values and appreciate the
complexity in the world. i blame it on working in hollywood too
long."
my voice or my laugh
""
my smile :-)
"my smile, my nonjudgmental warmth, my smarts. i feel i should
mention up-front the ways in which i am not typically girly: i
don't want children of my own, although i am well known for
enchantingand being utterly enchanted by--babies and small
children. (taking portraits of new parents with their babies is a
major hobby, and i'm also very close to my niece and nephew.) i
also love eating but hate cooking, since the prep work feels like a
tedious waste of time. (there, i said it!) for the same reason, if
you have a dog be forewarned that i will not go to the dog park
with you or walk your dog around the block. i don't plan my day
around other people's animals, and i frankly hate routine. if
you're looking for a domestic goddess, move on."
"i honestly don't know.<br />
<br />
later on? that i'm down-to-earth. that what you see is what you
get."
"my smile, easy going nature, and how approachable i am."
"haven't really asked, but people sometimes comment on my size..."
"i'm pretty tall, or so i've been told on multiple occasions."
"i have a weird name. however, very few people actually call me by
my real name as i have hundreds of nicknames."

"the huge blotches of holi color on my face. but seriously, my smile
and sense of humor."
is that people thinks i am younger than i am.
""
i've been told my smile.
"you tell me. everyone has a different perspective,, but i hope
people notice my smile and can feel my heart."
"i am a snarky motherfucker and my tolerance for dumb is low. i try
to be nice, but if you aren't entirely confident about your ability
to be clever on the spot i might scare you away. but never fear, i
am easily diffused- if you can make me laugh.<br />
<br />
oh, the tattoos. people probably notice those too.<br />
<br />
what people usually don't notice is my age. it's safe to say that
i'm more savvy than a lot of people under 25 i've met."
"recently, i've been getting a lot of people saying i look like tin
tin. still trying to figure out if that's a good thing."
"all the hair on or around my head because i have a big beard an
long hair. or my voice, its deep and i'm often told i sound just

international man of mystery. obviously.

probably because i have an australian accent)"
i'm nothing like that guy in high fidelity.
how would i know? i guess these days it might be the lip ring.
four-eyes.

my eyes...most think i'm part asian or native american
"i'm easy to talk to and very personable. i am always trying to
connect people. oh and i am pretty sarcastic."
"i usually just get told i look familiar, if i had to pick one thing
though i'd say my smile - i was voted best smile in middle school,
but maybe that's because everyone else had braces!"
"blue eyes, constant grin."
i'm pretty excited about something
"i sound quiet and girly, apparently. i always think i have a manly
voice but no one seems to agree with me..."
i'm a good listener and have a calming effect on people.
"are my blue eyes, beard, and new yorker's stride."
""
probably the silver streak in my hair.
""
i look atleast 5 years younger than i actually am.
"i am the life of a party...whether or not i am supposed to be. i
cannot help it. it just turns out that way most of the time. my
friends tell me its because i am an only child. i think its cause i
am kind of awesome.<br />
<br />
and that i allegedly love hats! well, not allegedly. i do in fact
love hats!"
"i win a lot of those ""guess your age"" games at carnivals."
"damn, that's one tall hombre!"
confidence
"my new york accent. yea, i have one. and it's thick"
"i'm not really sure. eyes? i make weird faces most of the time, but
no one really says anything about it. come to think of it, i have a
bizarre laugh, too, but it changes constantly."
"tall, slender, red hair already turning grey. i'm frequently told i
look younger than i am and that i have nice legs (for a guy)."
"my spit curls, my low (or lost) voice."

ridicoulousness ;)"

that's better than steve buscemi or something."
""
"this is kind of lame, but probably my laughter. because you'll
probably hear it before you see me."
"that what i just said didn't make any sense at all. i talk too fast
and my english sometimes sounds funny. i say ""jail"" when i meant to
say ""yale"" but that's ok. friends beg me to pronounce ""milkshake""
to get a laugh. oh well."
my eyes? my unique sense of style? my bald pate?
"right now it is my chipped tooth from a biking accident (that will
get fixed on 10/17 ;-), but i guess that is not what you're looking
for. i guess i am tall, usually looking like i am a man on a
mission. when people talk to me they tend to oscillate between
thinking i am british, australian, or south african, with good
reason."
"i look familiar, like their niece or their friend from high school
or someone they met at a party. i like to think it's because i'm
friendly."

recently, i was having dinner in this little vegan resto called elf
cafe when a woman asked me if she could feel my cheekbones to make
sure they were real. i was flattered. she was surprised. my

smart: ""hey! you're really tall, do you play basketball?""<br />

it is usually something that i am wearing.
my height
"i'm cool like that. i'm chill like that. i roll like that. i'm slim
like that. cuz i'm smooth like that. jk, people usually notice that
i'm short, but hopefully its short and cute."
"the first thing people usually notice about me is that i'm honest.
i am pretty random sometimes too. i make fun wherever i go! people
also notice my curves. but please no creepers!"
the endless amount of jewelry one girl can pile onto one body.
"my butt chin? that i'm either singing or making a bad pun? i
dunno.<br />
<br />
people often say i have nice eyes, and i get called cute and/or
adorable but only sometimes handsome. that's okay with me."

is that i'm quiet.
"my height and the fact that i do not have a southern accent even
though i am from the south."
"i'm really friendly, and that i'm fairly tall for an asian guy."
i am energetic and positive.

shamefully messy car, my huge wine collection for a student and my
ridiculous looking running shoes :)"
"my ridiculous height, especially when i'm on rollerskates"
""
"i have no idea. probably that i'm in their way, or i'm laughing too
loud, or i'm being kind of creepy reading alone in a bar. someone
should tell me.<br />

my hair is finally completely its natural color, so sadly it's not
my most noteworthy feature."
my eye lashes. weird but true.
"poor attitude, unpleasant to be around, bad hygiene, threatening"
"i have foot in mouth disease...just realize how fetishist that
sounds literally..so i don't mean it literally, but figuratively."

"i think i smile and say hello to strangers more than most people,
so not-being-a-dick is probably right up there with the first
things people notice. i'm guessing next on the list would be my
impeccable hygiene."
that i'm effervescent and joie de vivre
"likely, my voice...then the lips behind that"
smile alot.
"i can be quiet at first; i like to observe and take things in
before opening up. on a physical side, i take care of myself and
look young for my age."
i laugh a lot and am fairly sarcastic.
heavy metal is in my blood!
i'm super tall and a big curvy girl
"my quietness and serious nature...as well as my sense of humor and
wit"

i smile a lot and have nice eyes.

satanic."
my eyes and hilarious sense of humor. :)

recording of a previous laughing session)), that i'm smiling at
them and saying hello, that i'm drifting into their lane"
"appearance wise? probably that i have pink streaks in my hair. it's
very scandalous."
my smile and hair
"i be honest and say that most people think i'm shy and quiet but
that is not true. i might seem like that but the reason for it is
because i don't know what to talk about at first. but other than
that i'm pretty easy to get along"
"big smile with great teeth, black thick hair"
"when i was in college it was the alcohol collection i kept - pretty
much a fully stocked bar plus two racks of wine. on a near nightly
basis had friends over for a few drinks."
my eyes and smile.

really no response other than ""yes i am""."

maybe my smile? i dunno, you tell me."
"my magnificent abs, smile like polished ivory taken straight from a
mighty african bull elephant, and my amazing humbleness."
"these days, probably my sunglasses. i'm currently sporting purple
with neon reflective lenses. obnoxious, really."
"i smile a lot.<br />
<br />
wait, are you being serious?<br />
no, probably not."
"bright blue eyes, wide smile, and ""jovial disposition"" (as my
friends put it). i come off as someone who would be a really good
friend - and i think when it comes to relationships, it's important
to have a foundation of friendship that romance can build on."
"that i'm either too hyper or too relaxed lol. but not crazy hyper
nor lazy relaxed."
"i've developed the habit of applying eye makeup. that usually gains
attention.<br />
<br />
otherwise, my obnoxiously large chest is hard to avoid."
"i have a confident presence, and i am very independent, so people
might see me when i'm by myself in places women might not often be."
i'm an old soul wrapped up in a tiny human package
colors. i like to wear bright colors since they make me happy :)

shit but someone told me i have one the other day and now i'm
constantly aware of it."

"that i'm human, i can only assume."
fuck if i know. i get a lot of comments about my beard and my eyes.
"my eyes. i don't know why, but everyone tells me i have really nice
eyes. they're usually either an emerald green color or a deep
hazel. they change colors xd<br />
or my dyed red hair. or my joisey accent."
"depends on the situation. if we're in a dog park i might seem
extremely extroverted in an ""i want to steal the french bulldogs""
kind of way. while dancing, i let loose usually look good doing
what i do. in most other situations i'm the serious girl making
conversations unnecessarily serious."

i'm a friendly guy.

my accent, a friend said the accent is not what he noticed first
about me, seems like my half italian part makes me use my hands a

also, my laugh. it's loud. usually unacceptably so."
"either my aura of awesome radness or the fact that i'm tall,
probably the former."
would saying my eyes be too cliche?
"free spirit, broad shoulders, thick mess of hair and neatly trimmed
beard. i have kind of an intense look of seriousness when i'm
concentrating, but i tend to laugh that off fairly easily."

british and californian, it throws people off when they first meet
me."
my big blue eyes...or lack thereof.

extraordinary catch, you see."

eyes. a friend of mine recently said, ""i hate it when people say
'oh you have beautiful eyes,'"" this after someone said it to me,
""because it's overwhelmingly said to blue-eyed people, so it feels
like they're saying 'i believe aryan traits are superior.'"" she's
right. she also kinda bummed me out when she said it, but she's
right."

bit irreverent, dark, and bawdy in my humor sometimes.<br />

i love the color orange. as a friend pointed out, i tell people my
favorite color in the first five minutes of meeting someone like a
five year old. i took that as a huge compliment. who does not want

just face my fears quickly. in the evac, i was more worried about

<em>superhero</em>. ;-) wait until you see my <em>super
powers</em>. <em>i love <a class=""ilink"" href=

they're not half-bad <em>sidekicks</em>. they love me too, so we
make a good team."
that i'm sexy. jk i don't know though maybe my eyes.
im sexy...but i want more than you can muster.
"do i have headphone-head? i am not sure. i generally have eschewed
accoutrements like piercings, tattoos and green hair, so i may be
kind of nondescript from a distance.<br />

my interest in fashion extends mostly to ringer-t's in cool
combinations like yellow on blue, blue on red... i can never get
enough of them gildan ringers.<br />

i guess there's something about quaker that appeals to me - i tend
not to wear logos either."
"how ridiculously good looking i am...jk...probably the tiny
birthmark right on the very end of my nose. that and maybe my
height.<br />
<br />
when i lived in china an italian classmate told me i was the most
dubious looking person he had ever seen. i'm not sure if i was more
perplexed by that fact itself, or by the fact that someone who's
second language is english knew the word dubious."
i don't know...blue eyes?
i tend not to interrupt people during conversations.
"friendly, kind, charismatic and always out doing something!"
i'd be exactly the wrong person to answer this question...
my glasses.

<br />
in non-comedic settings, people usually notice that i am from
hawai'i as the first thing about me, followed second by my being
white. conversations usually go something like this:<br />

""oh, you're from hawai'i? cool!""<br />
question 1: ""do you surf?""<br />
reply 1: ""yeah, i know how to surf.""<br />
question 2: ""where are you originally from?""<br />
reply 2: ""hawai'i ""<br />
question 2a: ""oh, i mean, where is your family from?""<br />
reply 2a: ""hawai'i. ""<br />
question 2b: (for the most persistent): ""where are your
grandparents from?<br />
reply 2b: ""hawai'i. we're irish-german originally though.""<br />

the book i'm carrying...style/figure...smile :)
"that i like to tease and have a quick sense of humor. or maybe it's
that i have my shit together? or maybe my eyes?<br />
(slightly) related: no one has been able to precisely describe the
color of my eyes. they manage to be grey, green and blue all at the
same time. don't doubt it until you see me in person :p"

funny."

folks.<br />
oh wait, i know. my good looks :d"

and hair (when it's long) over the years."
green eyes- i has em.
"i'm pretty quiet sometimes so for some reason people notice that.
or my blue moccasins haha."
"i really have little idea, it's hard to be objective about these
things. i hope it's my irreverent sense of style and fashion and
the economic and graceful way i move through the world. but it's
probably my long and luxurious hair, tho i am so much more than a
hairdo. or this week's permutation of facial hair. and my generally
ill fitting trousers. i'm sartorially hopeless below the waist."
"i'm always wearing clothes when am outside,i can't be with out
music, photographic memory, and really bad with address, i like

most of my face is obscured in shadow, i look kinda good."
i would guess my eyes or my tattoos.

my height - i am definitely tall. really tall...

tattoo, my laugh, my sense of humor, my willingness to give"
the fact that they just noticed me
that i smile a lot!
""
"that i wear a hat.<br />
<br />
no, that's a lie. the fact that i wear a hat is what you will
notice about the last three times you saw me. it is brown and plaid
and has earflaps because it is a fucking convertible hat.<br />
<br />
what you will actually maybe notice about me is the fact that i
appear to have not shaved in approximately one week. this is a look
i manage to cultivate nearly 100% of the time, due to my owning a
time machine."
my ethnicity...people guess wrong all the time.
i am witty
"height? laughter (a recording of my laughter has broken a speaker
before) i'm not sure."
"my ass-less chaps.<br />
<br />
okay, really, they usually notice my scrotum piercing--it's
actually my scrotum's resemblance to justin bieber that makes them
first notice that i'm sweeter than justin bieber. then, they notice
that i'm naked.<br />
<br />
but honestly, it's my face. people always tell me i have a mediocre
face, at best. or, as my mom once told me:<br />
<br />
""you're not very good looking.""<br />
<br />
i know! but you know moms--they're pretty biased.<br />
<br />
i don't much like this question--all i really want to know is what
are the first things you would notice about me, or i about you. i
don't really care for you to provide the litany of what other
people notice about you: ""my eyes, my smile...but honestly,
probably my butt. haha!"" i mean, snore..... wake me up when
<em>i</em> get to notice your butt. wait, what?<br />
<br />
butt(sp?) forget all that. let's instead skip to common things
people have told me after they've gotten to <em>know me:</em><br />
<br />
""i love you.""<br />
<br />
""i want to <em>be</em> you.""<br />
<br />
""i hope my kids turn out as well as you.""<br />
<br />
""your <em>english</em> is <em>exceptional!</em>""<br />

""candy's not here tonight...would you like your complimentary lap
dance from starla instead, mr. ******?""<br />

""how did your sunday enema go?""<br />
<br />
""<strong>remove.</strong> your <em>tongue.</em> from my
<em>a**hole!!!</em>""<br />
<em>{but i always call their bluff on this one.}</em>"
"well,, i still get carded a lot,, so that's a good thing and get
told i look young for my age. :)<br />
<br />
also how fast i can walk up the hills of sf,, much practice and i
ride my bike or walk everywhere so i know how to get places in a
hurry."
"my sense of humor, my charm, how i totally could be a space ship
captain."
i'm not as tall as i seem...
"are my eyes and my smile? or my dog.... he's a spaz, but cute..."
"i have a beard, i don't wear skinny jeans as they are for girls,
and i bathe. i'm almost always smiling, i figure the crows feet
i'll have at 40 will be worth the time i had getting them."
"my hair and my height!<br />
the fact that my dog glukoza looks like me =) }=)"
"my flowing gold locks, beautiful blue eyes and boyishly handsom
smile. oh wait, that's brad pitt in legends of the fall. i don't
know, i haven't asked anybody that question, what did you notice
first?"
"my eyes or smile and my apparent calm demeanor (though my mind is
usually going non-stop)."
"they say i look like ""c"" from the movie ""bronx tale"""
perhaps my eyes? lots of people say i have nice eyes.
"i have no clue, to be honest. my beard? probably that. though it's
hard to say."
"most people comment on my green ""cat"" or ""bedroom"" eyes, wide
smile, wildly thick hair, height, or ass. i assume the first thing
noticed would be my approachable demeanor, or else nobody would
bother coming close enough to say anything at all."

"humm a shy guy haha yep yep and looks fobish i think haha not
really sure cuz i don't ask how or what they see in me when they
first met me"

it depends on the person and the situation .<br />
in warm weather - my lack of clothes - people normally notice my
tattoos . in other instances i suppose its my spicey personality
.<br />
you tell me ?"
"my smile, i get quite a few compliments on the way that i smile
when i meet new friends. i'm able to relate easily to people and to
make friends. i'm also very sensitive to and perceptive about
others' feelings."
"my height, or lack there of."
"my mixed accent.<br />

my favorite was the priest in terre haute who once said: ""if you
don't mind me saying this, sir, your accent doesn't fit your
face...""<br />
<br />
hey, it was a different time back in 2002."
my sick clothes
my smile/big teeth.

my temperament, i tend to be quiet at first but will open up as i
get more comfortable with a new situation or person."

sunny in philadelphia."

not sure about this one. maybe you can let me know...

the sparkle in my eyes when i am doing things i love
that i'm vain
i honestly have no idea.

have to say my height is most noticeable."
"i think people tend to tell me only things that are complimentary.
i have heard from people who had a high (exaggerated!) impression
of my intelligence, but it's pretty rare that people i've only just
met remark about their observations of me. you will have to let me
know what you notice."
my smile?

my height and curly hair
my german accent.
"major smile wattage. curves. that i actually dress like i give a
damn."

a crowd, we agree to meet at me."

expenses."

sticklers, i'll update my pic as soon as i get one)."
my nose. i've heard the ring suits me.
my smile.
"what are you?"""
"how relaxed they feel when they are around me.<br />
my eyes and my smile."
you would have to ask themhopefully each is different.
"""you're tall."" that, and then the less-spoken but surely present
smittenness at the sparkle in my eyes, the empathy of my smile, the
loyalty and dedication of my friendship, the genuineness of my
interest, and my willingness to go anywhere and do anything for an
adventure with friends. but since the first part is usually the
only part articulated i often just have to say ""yes,"" and hope that
everything else made it between the lines."
"my innate ability to lighten the mood. also, my smile."
""
"i had to go to the experts for this one and i got a bunch of
different answers.<br />
one of my friends told me they noticed my eyes first, however
another friend then laughed and replied that was a complete
falsification and he was just trying to be nice. the next reply was
the lips which seemed to be much more acceptable. personally i
found the whole exchange quite amusing.<br />
another reply was that i like to bat at things like a cat, it was a
rather surprising answer as i was expecting something more feature
oriented but there's no accounting for the things people notice. if
you feel like confirming or denying any of them, let me know!"

is that i don't have a long island accent
"i've been called stylish and have been told i have a good eye<br />
i have a dry sense of humor<br />

you'll probably notice that i'm intensely looking at you.
"my shirt that says, these nuts ain't gonna suck themselves."
"i have a way of setting them at ease. i am a good listener and
often surprise people by recalling details of what they said at a
later time. some mistake me for being too serious but my humor
comes out when they least expect it. i like to keep people on their
toes. :)"

and am super creative in many ways. i have always thought outside
the box, which has mostly been a plus socially and professionally."

i'm a ginger...people usually say something about my hair.
plaid on plaid . . . on plaid? (and making it work)
"my height, blue eyes, sharp wit..."
i don't know my glasses. *shrugs*
""
"i know a little bit about everything and seem to have an opinion on
everything too. but don't worry, i'm a good listener as well :)"
"i guess my eyes. they are a pretty striking blue. it runs in the
family. when i'm with my brothers, it is kind of like the village
of the damned."
my eyes smile and wardrobe
i guess it might be my eyes. who knows?
"the pooh bear costume with green tentacles generates lots of
questions. not recommended for daily attire."
""
""
"i'm quiet at first, but my dry and irreverent sense of humor comes
out pretty quickly."
why don't you tell me...
"my pale, irish skin. i'm just assuming."
""
that i would make a great housewife
my blue eyes.
you can tell me when we meet.
"that i probably have a staring problem. or a spacing-out problem.
or both."
"i'm not too sure, but often times i hear my smile. =)"
"i have a very familiar face. i'm often asked if went to high school
with some you know."
"my smile, my friendliness."
my blue eyes.
smile!!
is probably my sarcasm. or my incredible manners. maybe my sarcasm.
"i have it'll end in tears written on my forehead and would rather
talk to you about anything other than tattoos."
i make interesting faces without even knowing it.
"my long black hair, my big ass &amp; my eyes. my friends have
called me ""jtown face with an oakland bootie""....not sure if it's a
compliment or a dis...(*@_@*)"
""
"had to consult the friends for this one. apparently, i'm witty,
well-dressed, and easy to talk to."
i am not sure... what did you notice?
my eyes and smile.
"physically - eyes, beard.<br />
personality - smartass, helpful. i realize those sound mutually
exclusive."
"- wit. humor. my skin (soft, smooth, no hair - not like mr.
bigglesworth). thoughtfulness."
my name. boring but true.
my bright blonde hair and blue eyes.
blue eyes.
i guess maybe my shyness or that i'm athletic
"blue eyes and long limbs***<br />
<br />
the sarcasm is quick to follow<br />
<br />
***(i'm happy to reveal my identity, i just don't enjoy the idea of
gents coming into the bar recognizing me, knowing i'm single, and
taking away the possibility of them believing my fake boyfriend
exists.. just ask!)"
my eyes
it's in the eye of the beholder.
"my height and my skin complexion. my swagger/curb appeal and how
young i look"
are my blue and green eyes.
"goofy grin. i can smile normally as well, but why?"
i guess my smile.
my sense of humor and my white teeth.
"my oblivious dancing or oblivious reading. my ""expressive face""
which is basically my inability to hide my emotions, positive or
negative."
""
""
my smile....and then my laugh!
"my tattoos. i don't have a lot of them, but i do have two rather
geeky tattoos on my forearms. the typical reaction is either: ""woah
cool! legend of zelda!"" or ""what are those?"""
my ginger beard.
"i'm quite tall for being asian. bearded, at the moment. apparently
my boss thinks i look as though i am perpetually stoned."
they don't. ninja. 'nuff said.
"""wow, he makes a really unattractive face when he whistles."""
"my daperness! my instrument! seductive voice &amp; thunderous
laugh!"
"i guess my piercings. i have seven in total, with plans to get
more. my first lobes are also stretched to a 4 gauge and my seconds
are at a 12 gauge and i have my right nostril, septum, and tragus
pierced. i have one tattoo, on my finger. definitely want to get
more, but they will have to wait until after graduation.<br />
<br />
also people always say they can tell where i am depending on my
laugh. i have a boisterous laugh and i love to laugh. a sense of
humor is always a plus."
"i dunno, i have large eyes for chinese? haha"
i have a very big smile!
"that i'm the nice lady with the big... smile and slightly sarcastic
sense of humor."
"first 5 seconds: eyes and smile<br />
first 5 minutes: sense of humor<br />
first 5 years: loyalty, consistency"
"there are three things:<br />
<br />
1) my laugh - it is loud &amp; full of joy (like me!)<br />
2) my smile<br />
3) my eyes."
""
""
my smile
"my eyes. i know this sounds cliche, but they are yellow. seriously."
my hair or my eyes
"hopefully my charm. or the ability to laugh at myself...cause i
think that takes true character."
""
"my smile, easy to talk to"
my nose. it's weird.
"my adorable loving lil dog companion!<br />
that i often say hello to and/or smile at strangers?<br />
my bike? my blue eyes? my long legs?"
""
my halo
fun and talkative.
"red. hair. yes, we gingers don't have souls. figured i might as
well get it out of the way."
""
either my nerdy glasses or inability to take things too seriously
"it's been awhile since i've asked someone, so i'm really not sure."
how much better looking i am than my friend gregg alpert.
"<strong>wit, passion &amp; energy</strong>."

my eyes or smile.
"my head of hair, my mile."
my eyes... but i get sick of hearing it
"my glasses and my buzzed head. sometimes people tell me i look like
moby."

"* my smile<br />
* my sense of humor<br />
* my inability to hide what im thinking or feeling"
"my primary mode of transportation is a large white horse.<br />
<br />
also, this question is stupid."
i am not sure what people notice about me...
"not really sure on that one, maybe you could help me with that."
"i would guess my eyes, but i've never polled anyone before. my eyes
change color depending on what i'm wearing (blue to blue-green) and
i have pretty large pupils a lot of the time for whatever reason
(which gets even more comments than you would expect since i work
around a lot of optometrists). in the event that i sneeze, that
might be the most memorable thing though... (its pretty loud and i
just can't help it!)"
"hopefully, that i'm wearing a shirt in all my profile
pictures.<br />
<br />
that i just missed an obvious cue to ask for your number. or that i
realized it hours later while working and suddenly shout ""dammit""."
my awesome fair skin or how mellow i am.
""
"depends on where i am. in the us, people tend to notice my accent
as not being american (but they can't place itit's about 60%
american nonetheless). in europe, it can be my turkish looks.
anywhere else i've no idea."
"my cracked iphone screen. come on, wwdc, iphone 5 please and thank
you."
"in this country, my name. in other countries, that i live in the
usa. not sure what exactly they pick up on. i hope i don't smell
american."
"im not really sure, you'll have to tell me."
""
"im glued to my phone! most likely yelping what place is good around
me to go eat :)"
"my hair. it's rather striking since it's brown on my head, platinum
blond on my eyebrows, and red on the rest of my face"
""
typically something i'm wearing that they like.
not sure. never really asked people this question before.
"eyes, i think? but you tell me!"
"depends the angle.......<br />
smile from the front, booty from the back"
""
"is my height. maybe i'm biased, but people tell me i'm tall a lot.
whenever i go home and see my parents all of the friends and family
i run into tell me that they think i've grown since the last time
i've seen them."
"so my sister said my gregariousness. so then i stuck my head out
the kitchen window and asked my neighbor, she said ""you're open

my laugh and unique knowledge of pop-culture trivia.
"smile. also, i will make you laugh if you let me"

"that i'm kind of a goof-ball<br />
my eyelashes"
im quiet and shy but easy to get along with
"people notice my positive attitude and my confidence. i look people
straight in the eye when i talk to them."
"it depends on where people are looking. typically either my eyes,
smile or boobs although i have had guys check out my ass."
a great sense of humor and confidence to be who i am. big smile.
hmmmm? maybe you can tell me...
probably my eyes.
you tell me..
"notice? hands down --- my laugh. also my crazy face piercings and
tribal tats -- just jk."
""
that i'm...white? i've never asked.
""
it could be my aura / my smile...
"stellar sense of style and impeccable taste in handbags (okay,
maybe it's just the ladies who notice this about me). and wow,
she's short."
"probably my eyes: i'm told they're quite expressive, which doesn't
help me win any poker games."
my blue eyes
"my incredibly blue eyes, maybe my wooden glasses, sometimes my
t-shirt. but you'll probably hear me first."
""
"dimples.<br />
<br />
my smile maybe. hopefully my awkward braces phase was not in
vain.<br />
<br />
my carefree attitude.<br />

my ridiculous knowledge of pop culture."

back)"

been keeping it pretty short and less distracting."

"i smile a lot, and some say i talk a lot as well."
"if the people in question are id-checkers of any kind, then they'd
notice the giant crazy eyes i have in my driver's license photo.

my extremely bright red bike
"for some reason people always say i have a very distinctive walk.
it was once described to me as being a ""suave and floaty"" kind of
walk. as for other things: i guess you would have to ask someone
who recently saw me for the first time."
my tail.
"i am a quiet person, have very blue eyes, and i like plaid."
"kinda random question, nobody's ever told me. what did you notice?"

not okay, especially if you are asking me for money)."

"this is the last thing i'd like to think about. maybe deep down i
have this naive hope that people will directly interface with my
consciousness and thoughts rather than noticing superficial
attributes like my eyebrows or shoes or fondness for striped
shirts..."
"i don't know... maybe my sweet demeanor... messed up hair... or
possibly my sharp wit? then again it might just be my super hot
ass. ;-)"
the confused look on my face.
i can't hide facial expressions at all and i smile as a catch-all.
that guy hasn't said two words since he got here.
"the fact that im black and i speak pretty (so i've been told
lol)....and the tits"
my smiley eyes.
"my size. i'm 6'4"" with broad shoulders and dark features, making me
fairly difficult to miss in a crowd. however, don't let that throw
you off, i'm actually quite gentle. unless you don't want me to be."
"i'm asian??? not sure, how would i know what other people notice?
tell me what you first notice about me and maybe i'll have
something relevant to write in this box. then i'll return the favor
and tell you too."
"my hair, it's bright red."
""
"my eyes or my blunt honesty. or that i'm freestylin' like an albino
word ninja...."
that i am asking them a lot of questions.
"upon reflection, i think people tend to notice me less and notice
what i'm doing more (e.g. when i was attempting to climb into a
second story window with a bloody foot after locking myself out of
my apartment while taking out the trash, people were watching what
i was doing more than they were watching me)"
"i challenge their sense of determining what's deadpan and what's
not."

pot belly for sure !
my eyes and my smiles.
"i'm a natural blonde, and i'm not afraid to start conversations
with strangers."
"i think maybe that they can't figure out what ethnicity i am. i get
asked that a lot. or they just come out speaking to me in spanish.
i got real good at saying ""no hablo espanol"", but i'm learning more
and more every day. now i can say ""hablo un poco espanol"". yeah,
that's what's up."

love my spontaneity and my ever so growing love to help others."

well spoken. i care deeply about other people. i still do little
poorly choreographed dances when im happy, im super ticklish (do so
at your own risk cause i flip out) i make up words, and i spout
gibberish so much that my close friends have begun to understand me
anyway. i curse more than i should... sorry im working on it. i
smell good... or like weed... or both... usually both. i have lots
of energy but im also pretty laid back, im always down for whatever
but im just as content to lay around the house all day"

too much."

nice? i just like looking atcha, i swear. if there is music, i am
dancing. i also tend to be reserved at first, but that usually
changes as soon as i've got you sussed out."
""
"physically it would have to be that i have a scar and some bruises
on my face. personality wise i am quiet and very considerate of
others."
""
"the funny thing about being a quiet person is that people tend to
get the wrong idea about you. ive had a lot of people tell me,
after they have met me, that they thought i was mean or an asshole
before we met. this could not be further from the truth. im just
reserved at first and then i open up the door and let you in. i
think it has something to do with growing up in the
northeast.<br />
im also very modest so this is hard to say. but here goes ... my
eyes ( ive been dubbed clooney eyes by friends who get a kick out
making me feel awkward) and also my smile ( its not around all the
time but when it comes out its great) and i got a nice butt too!"
"i have this slight crook in my nose. i got it at this between the
buried and me show (brownie points if you know the band and genre)
which someone broke after delivering a fist into it. i've got some
tattoo's, i usually have headphones on or my face in a book (while
i walk, yes, i live dangerously)."
"who cares? for me, someone can seem attractive - or less attractive
- at 1st glance but what they say/are doing/their energy can flip
that.<br />
<br />
i will say, however, that in the case of most every man i've been
involved with, i remember the 1st instant i saw him. but, it's not
necessarily 'his eyes', 'his smile' - it's some other kind of flash
of intuition or recognition that comes from i know not where..."
""
"hair and dancing. if only i had dancing hair. although i currently
have short hair so i gather it's not stopping any traffic these
days.<br />
sometimes, i get ""you look like someone i know..."""
"at the moment my mustache. when i dont have facial hair people
always compliment me on my hair not sure why but maybe you can
enlighten me."
my blue eyes (so i have been told).
"buzzed head, blue eyes and long eyelashes - that and my third
earlobe."
my smile.
"the number one drunk exclamation i get while i am working? ""you're
soooo taalll."" the heels don't exactly help, but i'm a lil over
5'10"" as it is."

that i'm bootylicious for an asian girl."
i've been told that i put people at ease very quickly.

that's just the east coast thing. but probably that's because i am
an asshole."

i'm rich and famous.

that's self indulgent.<br />
we can talk about the alliteration later...<br />

i have no idea. i'd never ask someone ""what's the first thing you

because people assume i'm nice and sweet."
""

i don't think anyone's ever told me?
la face with an oakland booty.
"well, you'd really have to ask them or see for yourself. i seem to
strike people as tall, though i'm only about 6'1"", but slender, so
.. other than that, though, i think i tend to fly under the radar a
bit."
"when my hair is curly, people often ask ""has anyone ever told you
you look like minnie driver?"" (answer: ""yes - i hope you mean
minnie driver in grosse point blank not circle of friends?"")<br />

when my hair is straight, people often ask ""you straightened your
hair. how long did that take? how did you do that?"" (answer:
""didn't you see the mushroom cloud over the castro?"")"
i've gotten a lot of compliments on my dimples oddly enough haha

disarming to folks who appreciate frivolousness, or annoying to
really serious people.<br />

nerves. i'm pretty noxious, and obnoxious.<br />

ummmmmmmm, i also wear a cape most of the time. and i never take
off my helmet. waaahaaay toooo risky."

besides that i have great personal style. i love to play with
clothes and consider my style to be pretty diverse from vintage
dress and sexy stilletos to leather motorcycle jackets and
exclusive sneakers. i love it all<br />

but if people actually took the time to look past they would
probably notice that im extremely ambitious and driven and
passionate about my craft. im also pretty positive and like to

seriously and understand that i am a person of integrity. that i
have a great deal of compassion for my fellow human being. my

unique quality to my voice and even though i can't hear it, that i

easily i laugh, i suppose?<br />
i'm peruvian but i don't speak a word of spanish (sad).<br />

about myself mid casual conversation. take that as a compliment if
i do though. means i think you can probably handle it..."

i often hear i'm a lot nicer than people assume from afar (i think
it's a plus!) and i am compassionate. as mentioned above, i am
involved in animal rescue (all of mine are rescues) and try to find
happy homes for these overlooked creatures. amazingly, i've found
homes for almost all of them (apart from two seniors who died but
i'm grateful to say that they died in a home instead of a cell). i
am usually called upon for ""special needs rescues"". that said, i
strive for balance. meaning, i'm fairly pragmatic and i don't have
a home or personal life overrun by animals. i tend to be the person
they call upon for challenging situations. also, i am equally

runaways which is an honor for me."

genuine is a great way to describe the type of person i am and it's

i am not a basketball player. i don't play sports (surprise). it's
because of my height that i like ""beefier"" guys who make me feel
smaller. people also notice my legs. i am a lightening fast walker

girly hair, so i guess those could count. i like to think i have
stunning, heartthrob-worthy eyes, but i'm probably fooling myself
(but they're so blue! i swear!).<br />
<br />
they probably notice that i'm rather quiet and often lost in my own
mind. i think a lot about everything, and so it tends to keep me a
bit distracted, even mid-conversation. i find i pay attention to a
lot of different things at once all around me, so i think some
people feel that i'm not emotionally invested in the conversation
at hand because i'm busy trying to see the cover of that book that
that guy on the bench is reading, or trying to guess how many
windows could be in that building by counting the rows, and
multiplying it by the number of windows in each row,
and.....and.....wait, i swear i'm paying attention to what you're
saying, but i'm also paying attention to all this other cool stuff
going on!<br />

"that i'm a... wait, is that a girl or a boy?"
i'm loud. my lips?
"i look younger than i really am<br />
im vertically challenged<br />
my animated expression"
"hey, another white guy with a beard living in san francisco."
"i'm taller and blonder than most women. when i'm not talking, i am
smiling or laughing 90% of the time and my personality has been
described as ""bubbly"""
i strike up a conversation easily.
my eyes and smile
i'm tall and kind of loud and probably gesticulating wildly?
are my peg leg and hook.
""
"my smile, and eyes..."
i'm hot.
"i look a lot younger than i actually am. which is both a blessing
and a curse."
"my gorgeous hair! its really my best asset and i like trying new
colors to mix it up. i am not the typical barbie type, but am super
healthy and active, so i appreciate others who take care of
themselves."
uhhh....dimples maybe ?
"personality wise? my sense of humor i guess is usually the first
thing that comes out when i meet people. i'm not a genius but i'm
pretty smart and i like conversing with people who are interested
in things outside of their own personal bubble. i'm extremely open,
extremely honest, and very laid back. if you have the balls to ask
me a question i have the balls to answer it, no matter the
question. i love all facets of humanity, and as long as you're not
a total douchebag or a complete moron i will get along with you."
"i am not very tall, but hey i am a short asian girl, so? :d people
notice that i am very eloquent and easy-going, very easy to bond
with, and confide in. i give really good advices, and can switch
easily bewteen being a talker and a listener. a lot people tell me
that i have this happy aura around me, my smile can be very
contagious :), on the other hand, i am concentrated with work and
studying, and i am very responsible. i can be comfortable talking
to any one. i have the ability to have a great time with
introverted people too. a lot of people open up to me"
i eat healthy and excercise and as a result i have a nice physique.
"my limp. but some people won't notice it until they're known me for
years."
i have no idea...you tell me
my awkwardness
"i speak french, english, arabic and i understand spanish but cannot
quite speak it yet. i'm sociable and i always go toward people. i'm
energetic and like to be in control."
my enthusiasm and smile
my milkshake and what it subsequently brings to the yard.

my witty outbursts.
"is that i'm always sure about the right thing to do. although, they
eventually realize i was faking certainty the whole time.<br />

physically, it's that i'm probably the tallest brown person you
know."

yourself."

"the first things??? can it be the first thing? :):):) i really
don't know... that i have an accent ? ;) i really don't know."
"quite definitively, it's the moustache. or it was before i trimmed
it. seems everyone misses that.<br />
<br />
now its either that i no longer am sporting the van dyk, or that
i'm quite a bit more trim than i was last year this time."
"my height, my expressive eyes, my infectious laugh.<br />
<br />
now, for something completely different: i have been known to
demonstrate a silly walk or two."
"physically: my dimple and my.....eyes?<br />
<br />
emotionally: my obvious avoidance of anything serious"
""
""
"i have an accent so people usually ask where i'm from. height, loud
laughter would be my guess. how ruggedly handsome, smart and funny
are things i hope people see first. who knows?"
"personality wise. i have been told i am really friendly and easy to
talk to. i am usually genuinely interested in people's stories,
especially if i just met them, so maybe that's where that comes
from?<br />
<br />
physically, i have been told i have a nice smile and eyes, but i'll
leave that up to you. also, probably my well trimmed beard?"
"that my dog is more adorable than i am. i give him a run for his
money most days."
depends which way i'm facing.
my super ultra manly lumberjack beard?
my pretty smile! did i just say pretty?
""
my eyes. they're big and uniquely colored. ;)

of fashion."

i am not sure!
that i'm incredible in bed

"my smile.. get that too often even when im supposed to be sad or
angry.."

has to be my first impressions."
"if you are open with me, i follow suit."
my eyes
"i sometimes wonder about this, but rarely get a satisfactory
answer. i would guess it's my clothes, my eyes, or my smile which
i'm told is a winner though rarely captured in photographs."
"the red hair, i'm a ginger"
""
""
my eyes and smile
"my eye contact, walk, smile -- the sweet and direct way i roll."
"is my fingers. i have 10. i also wish girls were less obvious when
they stare at my chest."
"the first things people seem to notice is that i am personable,
engaging, and approachable. i'm not afraid to ask someone questions
to find out wants important to them."
""
i come from a long line of people who tend to talk to strangers.
the last things people usually notice are my huge biceps.
""
"more than likely my eye contact, sense of humour, and smile. i
don't know, actually.<br />
<br />
if we hang out, you will notice that i get approached by curious
people alot. some want to ask about piercings/tattoos/jewelry, some
(most) ask about my magnificent bulldog beast. i am approachable
and friendly (hell, i'm downright informative) as these topics
comprise significant portions of both my lifestyle and my business
( i am somewhat of a walking business card). therefore, if you dont
like interacting with total strangers, you probably would want to
run and hide.<br />
<br />
perhaps i will start inquiring this of new people i meet. i'll get
back to you, cupid."
uhhh. i have a face. it's really real.
"<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=angst"">angst</a><br />
i get eye comments sometimes, usually from black girls. i
appreciate it, and yes, i am available for any kind of white-boy
fetish exploration needs for any ""urban"" demographic out there. i
am even quite politically incorrect, and in fact, extra white, if
that makes it more titillating. but i do know who the original
members of nwa were, so i'm down."
"my eyes, smile, bright attractive appearance, style &amp; sweet
personality.. also my russian accent"
really?
my smile.
""
"let's be honest...my butt. people usually say i have a nice smile
and eyes. i am fun and outgoing, but i am sure everyone else on
this site claims to be too. if i could resemble a celebrity i would
say the closest would be shakira."
maybe you could tell me.
my smile
""
"a friend recently told me that i dress like a gay hipster man. i
was slightly flattered, but mostly offended."
"when someone texts me, i call back often instead of text. i know
it's disarming sometimes, but i prefer it."
i'm thin.
"i dunno if anyone's ever told me, and if they did, i'm sure it was
so embarrassing i chose to forget it. i did have a drunk guy refer
to me as ""john belushi"" all night long once. i wasn't very amused.
but if you're secretly attracted to john belushi, i can pretend to
be (amused). i don't think i look like john belushi."
my eyes.
"long hair, greenish eyes, casual attire, eccentric food
aversions..."
"for some reason its my height, but i'm only 6 feet. also, i happen
to have darker skin than most people, which is weird because i've
definitely seen many other people darker than me........."
my gold tooth cap with embedded diamond. actually my white teeth.
"my tattoos more than anything. i occasionally find myself damning
my love of ink largely because i now relate to pregnant women in
the way the general populace unanimously agrees pregnant bellies
are somehow public property, ie; i get touched a lot by
strangers.<br />
also to my chagrin, i bear a frighteningly close resemblance to
lisbeth salander from that movie i don't want to mention because i
kind of resent it now.<br />
on my way to australia, waiting in line to subject myself to
customs protocol, a man fifteen feet behind me yelled, ""hey,
lisbeth! i loved your movie!!""...i gave him the finger. had it not
been 5am, i might have glared instead....."
eyes + laugh
"i smile and pay attention. i fight a losing battle with my beard. i
have red hair.<br />
<br />
they never notice my eyebrows. they're stealthy."
"i can get along well with anyone and make a very good first
impression. ironic because i'm actually a bit shy on a second
meeting."
"my hair, i would assume. its all blue and stuff. but other than
obvious physical traits maybe that i'm a bit of an awkward spaz?"
that i'm 5 foot 1 of badass bitch/fatty cow goddess
"i had someone tell me (who i was not dating) that i was ""the
perfect boyfriend height"". take that as you will.<br />
<br />
i heard i have a nice smile too."
let's see...hmm....
"if i must be honest--this is the internet after all--i've been
called chelsea clinton enough times to practically make me the
clintons' long lost daughter. really this is a much better thing to
hear these days than when we were 13 and awkward (who wasn't?), but
all the same, glad for my relative anonymity."

they usually notice my dog first.
not sure...my eyes?
"i'm well put together. i'm likeable. i'm never up-tight, too
anxious, nervous. most people regard me as very friendly."
"i'm tall and i don't talk very much. people are pleasantly
surprised as i come out of my shell though :)"
"i guess i'm really half city and half country (or half country and
half city) and couldn't imagine life any other way. i'm paradoxical
and live a life where i spend equal parts floating in a canoe on a
lake, or photographing a vineyard, and equal parts wearing cocktail
dresses at charity benefits, going to museums, relaxing in
flip-flops or walking in the soft sand. if you own a tent and a tux
you might just be my guy."
i'm an optimist.
the ridiculous amount of bright colors i'm wearing.
im very loud.
my mustaches i guess?
eyes and lips and brains

sitting. generally the beverages. a minimum of 3 are needed at all
times. i carry around ridiculously large bag full of beverages at

i'm not very asian.
i am easy going....
"coming: blue eyes.<br />
going: nice buns.<br />
by phone: deep voice.<br />
by text: tortured syntax."
"i'm usually the one saying the obnoxious funny thing that i suspect
everyone was secretly thinking."
"my smile, my eyes, and my constantly evolving hair styles/colors
are what i am known for in the physical aspect (not as prominent as
it used to be, due to school, but i still try to push the limit). i
am very witty, silly, intelligent, fun, and i can probably make you
laugh.<br />
<br />
also, that i always have something that i feel very
happy/passionate about permeating my mind but it's not something
trivial."

i tend to be reserved around folks i don't know. it's short lived.

my charm and my swagger
the first thing people notice about me is my height.

don't find out immediately, it is something that they remain
blissfully ignorant of for months.<br />

long hair beard thing we've got going on but that's about it. i am
also noticed by shy children and suspicious animals as they cuddle
up on me. people always comment on that."
""
you tell me.
"tattoos, good manners, hands, intense glance."
"my very bad sense of fashion which i hope will grow on you because
i like the way i look and wouldn't tend to change (unless i won the
lotto and started actually reading details and gq instead of just
cruising the ads). or maybe i am very proud of how much i can break
the fashion rules and still justify it in my own mind. oh and if im

don't. well, maybe sometimes, but only after i meet them and they
turn out to be assholes.<br />

according to people on this site, my profile is ""intimidating"" and
i seem ""arrogant"".<br />
<br />
i would be ashamed to be arrogant, but i will not display a modest
pretense, since modesty is not much better than arrogance. yes, it
is endearing when someone is amazing and *does not know it*, but
modesty (as i am defining it) is really just another form of
arrogance... believing in your virtues and then publicly denying
them, as you would have seen done by girls in my 4th grade art
class; that game has become less overt, but i dislike it no less."
i haven't a clue.
"how short i am, or my big green eyes"
"i'd like to say my eyes or something. but the truth is..fine, fine,
fine....probably my ass"
"would like to say my eyes but i am going with the most common thing
said to me ""wow, your short..."" it's usually followed by me saying
""yes, i sure am. glad you noticed"""

crowd without anyone noticing, like an international man of

confirm nor deny that."

which the sun sets, hehe... just kidding. i really am not sure. i
think that most people consider me rather shy when they first meet
me. in all honesty, that is just me assessing the situation and
gathering a grasp on their personality. shortly afterward i think
that they take notice of my ability to communicate very well with
them and perhaps that i'm a pretty genuine nice guy."

a good amount of the time, and almost always around those with whom
i feel comfortable i am extroverted and appeal to others better

passionate about anything that interests me. i value honesty over
tact. i am very interested in what makes others tick, and this
reflects a curious and highly analytical streak of mine. i am
individualistic and self-directed and somewhat of an outsider by
nature. i can be provocative yet non-judgmental as i quickly cut to
things that run deep in someone's character, their inspiration or
aspiration. for this reason i can be a valued sounding board for
someone, even at a cocktail party. that's what you get in an hour."

smile"

wish to have their mommy still around. i won't hide that i'd like
to have children of my own one day. but that's still far away.
:p<br />
the thing i hear most is that i come across very motherly and
nurturing. i have a bit of a motherly instinct that i've always
had. i like to take care of people and i definitely want to have
children of my own. being a mom is one of my biggest dreams in
life. but don't worry. i'm not looking for a daddy yet. :p<br />
the second thing they notice is that i'm very bubbly and
motivating. i'm happy a lot and i like to make other people happy
too. so i just smile and try to make someone else's day. sometimes
i find myself being a little too present.. but that's why i love a
guy who will just tell me that i am being a pain in the bum and is
not afraid to hurt my feelings or is too intimidated to say
something about it. even though i get my way a lot i think a guy is
supposed to be a dominant figure, it's attractive for me. as for
the motivational part i would say it's positive manipulation. :). i
try to blink, use my puppy eyes and pout my lower lip to get guys
to do something positive, i'm not out to change personalities or
make drastic changes in people's lifes but if i feel that a quick
and easy change can make his/her day better than i will try to
help. :)"

"hmmmm i dont know, this question is for those people who notice me
lol haha<br />
<br />
ill just fill this part with results from a long questionnaire i
just took. i thinks its very accurate!! lol<br />
<br />
questionnaire results:<br />
<br />
as someone with high self-confidence, you feel quite comfortable
interacting with other people. indeed, you find the company of
others very stimulating and enjoy meeting new people. your relaxed
demeanor in groups makes people around you comfortable too. perhaps
because you feel comfortable talking about yourself, others tend to
enjoy being around you and perceive you as socially
competent.<br />
<br />
the confidence that helps you feel comfortable talking to people
also spills into your own personal beliefs about yourself. although
you have several strengths, it's likely that you also acknowledge
and accept your weaknesses.<br />
<br />
perhaps the defining feature that sets you apart from most people
is the exceptionally high standards that you set for yourself. your
competence in social gatherings as well as at work should provide
ample evidence for this. with these characteristics, it's very
likely that people come to you for advice and generally think of
you as someone with leader-like qualities.<br />
<br />
as someone high in openness, you have a strong appreciation for
beauty, both in art and nature. indeed, it's likely that you are
easily absorbed in music and art, as well as natural phenomena.
another aspect of your openness is your emotional insight; that is,
you probably have good access to and awareness of your own
emotions.<br />
<br />
easygoingness refers to one's ability to relax. based on your
score, you appear to work and play hard. the benefits of being
moderate in easygoingness are that you achieve success through hard
work, but you also know when and how to relax. your colleagues and
friends likely consider you as reliable and fun to be around.<br />
<br />
as someone who is neither rigid nor careless, you likely get along
with most people well. on the one hand, you recognize the value of
working hard and therefore consider such qualities in others
beneficial. on the other hand, you know how to relax and thus
appreciate people that know how to do this too. chances are your
friends and colleagues perceive you as someone that works hard, but
also knows how to have a good time.<br />
<br />
because you respect family values but appreciate a good night out
on the town, you probably get along well with people that are
different from you. for this reason, you would probably be quite
content in a romantic relationship with someone who shares your
same values on these issues. being in a relationship with someone
who enjoys going out to parties and staying-up late at night might
be fun, at least initially; yet it's likely that you will find this
tiring over time. thus, it might be easier and more satisfying for
you to develop a long-lasting relationship with a person who enjoys
both spending time at home and going out to eat.<br />
<br />
as someone who is more relaxed than most people, you'll likely be
attracted to most people. however, your free-spirited nature might
make being in a relationship with a person that is more rigid than
you difficult because you might perceive the person as being too
uptight and controlling. for this reason, you may ultimately be
most satisfied in a relationship with someone that is shares your
level of self-control.<br />
<br />
your openness probably makes it easy for you to respect and
appreciate people that are different from you. however, when it
comes to romantic relationships, your openness might make it
difficult for you to tolerate people that cannot appreciate
diversity as much as you. therefore, you may be happiest in serious
relationships with people that share your open-mindedness. but,
your openness might occasionally cause a certain degree of
dependency on your end because you may be so open that you easily
adopt the preferences and habits of your partners and gradually
relinquish things that make you so unique."

1/31/08 today (and days like it) i imagine that the first thing
that people noticed about me was that i was wearing shorts on a
cold, rainy day. it may seem strange (and its probably something i
shouldn't admit here) but basically i was getting tired of the
lower legs of my pants getting all wet and staying that way. plus,
i generate a lot of body heat so i'm rarely cold."
maybe you could fill me in on that.
i'm pretty short!

listener too, but love to share."

"i don't always talk a lot. it's a nordic thing - you know,
shouldn't waste body heat on idle words :)"
"hmmm... i've gotten some compliments about my smile in the past but
i honestly don't know what they notice first."
"my sunny disposition. recently a woman walked up to me at a
wedding, introduced herself, and asked me to pretend to be an alien
for her husband. he, having never met me, had decided that i could
not possibly be human because i was too smiley. so i talked into my
wrist, pretended to heed the response of the mother ship and dashed
out of the room. best wedding ever."
my sense of humor and my smile.

i'm good at gazing into your soul

he sure does have perdy hair for a boy
"people notice i'm a really nice guy and very patient. they all say
i age really well. really fun to hang out with."
i'm definitely overdressed.
"my hair, my eyes, my laugh and my heart full of gold."
"i can be somewhat awkward at first. i'm not great at making new
friends but i become very friendly once i get to know people. i
smile a lot which i got from my mom (i got pretty much everything
else from my dad...). i can be fairly sarcastic as well."
"my directness (sometimes mistaken for rudeness) and hazel eyes. and
my hands, for some reason. and my bronco, because it's loud."
my very cool t-shirts
my hair!!!!!
"my small korean eyes, my eyes get smaller if you make me
smile/laugh"
i dont know. but i am often told that i have perfect teeth.
amazonian height perhaps?

i'm easy to talk to.
my hair. it has a mind of it's own. my green eyes

"good hair - and a lot if it. once we start talking, they may notice
i'm pretty funny (if i do say so myself)"
probably my eyes or smile. :)
my hair and all of its lusciousness!
my passion.

someone notices. but besides that i tend to be a smart ass lol!"
"i don't know, either my lush, well defined eye brows or my sense of
humor? i'll get back to you once i find out."
"my black leather trenchcoat<br />
<br />
according to my friends, people usually hear my laugh before they
see me, then see me smiling. reports that i giggle, however, are
libellous and shall be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."
"i am a soulless ginger, or that i am huge like a midwestern style
farm boy. it might also be my funny tattoos. also my red hair and
darker red beard has brokered some attention for those who are not
scared of the soulless."
"my shyness. i'm usually not talkative until i get comfortable with
a new person. yes, i know this is counterproductive especially in

my beer before them"
"clothing. it usually covers a good 80% of my body, and i'm pretty
tall, so i'm going to make a guess that it's clothing.<br />
<br />
advantage: it's better than being noticed for not having clothing,
plus the ensuing foot chase is a lot easier on my knees."
are my awful awful jokes.
"tall, dressed mostly in black, frequently loud."
"to be honest, i don't have a clue what is the first thing people
notice about me. maybe my hair? mexican face? my pinoy eyes?<br />
someone, please tell me!"

luscious locks? or my ability to inhale the food in front of me
within ten minutes?<br />
that's actually a funny one, and one good reason we should hang out
:)"
my dorky sense of humor.
"i used to think it was the fact i'm relatively tall, but more
recently people notice my rather unique accent. it's impossible to
place.<br />
<br />
also, i've been told both that i look better in person than in my
photos, <em>and</em> that i'm photogenic. paradox?"
that i am easy going guy.
"my easy going nature and always wanting to have a good time. my
friends always say i'm dressed up for the occasion."
"my sense of humor. i enjoy smiling and laughing at myself as well
as with others. i try to not take life to serious, it is short and
far to complex."
that i'm smiling
"i'm a very open minded and logical person. as a person who has
lived in 6 different countries (italy, us, indonesia, philippines,
nepal, sri lanka) and visited many more, i'm open to many different
ways of looking at the world. i find people with a broad
perspective of cultures and mindsets very interesting."

haha.<br />
but physically, i guess the eyebrow piercing."
"it might be a plain response, but it's really the first thing
people notice about me.<br />
i always have people whom i'm just first meeting ask, ""are you half
white and half-*insert some type of asian*."" then i just amuse
myself and respond by having them guess. they usually guess every
type of ethnicity out there until they finally give up.<br />
<br />
why don't you take a crack at it? can you guess what my ethnicity
is?"
"my smile (nominated for best of in 7th grade) and my quiet
self-confidence and my ability to laugh at myself"
"nine times out of ten it's either my sideburns or my steampunk
ring."
my effervescence.
i'm easy going and optimistic
"i'm kinda big. well in a 6'1 200 lb built like a body-builder way..
i know that shouldnt be what people notice first .. but i have been
told i can be a bit intimidating. oh wells..<br />

the second thing they notice about me is that i am always thinking,
people always tell me that they can see the wheels cranking in my
head whenever i am having a conversation .. it's kind of true.."

my sense of humor as well."

i'm genuine.<br />

i'm in very good shape (but i know that including a picture
supporting this claim is like the douchiest move possible on okc)."
"i have healthy hair, and a lot of it."
i am a short one.
"right now it's probably the hair. right now the tips of my hair
haven't locked up yet, so they make these really weird curls. i got
called curley-q by a stewardess on a flight a couple of months ago.
i told her that if she drank as much espresso as i do, her hair
would look the same."
my height (i'm tall).
an impressive beard; the nice multitool i carry.
"what gets people is normally the looks, they tell me that it is i
am not being cocky. eyes also, and of course tell me i need to eat
more because i only weigh like 145 lol"

really."

i was lucky enough to be born with some pretty intense baby blues.
blue eyes and white teeth

putting it here.<br />
my accent? though slight, some people notice it.<br />
uh, i dunno! that i can embroider by hand, perhaps? hah. how very
impressive."

t-shirt i'm wearing. i do get lots of compliments on my eyes
though...."

then, they'd notice i'm a tall asian."

chance to not be so self-serious, i'll crack you up endlessly with
my dry and slightly dark sense of humor : )"

possibly give would be biased and self-deluded."

but frankly people get too worked up about the little things."

<br />
my favorite english teacher once told me that this quote was the
perfect description of me.<br />
<br />
""if personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then
there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity
to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those
intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles
away. this responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby
impressionability which is dignified under the name of the
""creative temperament""-it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a
romantic readiness such as i have never found in any other person
and which it is not likeley i shall ever find again"" (fitzgerald,
1925.)"
""
"i've been told it's my ""rack"""
"my poise, smile and friendly demeanor."
"that i can be quiet at first but it doesn't mean i'm shy. i just
need to get comfortable in new surroundings and do so by listening."
"my glasses and my swagger. my jaw line. my collarbones. that i look
like i know where i'm going and will help you if you're lost."
"red hair and the biggest grin this side of the mississippi! plus
i'm incredibly loud :p"
"smiley. i'm a loser who almost never stops smiling. must be the
drugs?"
""
""
"honest eyes,good personality"
"the first thing people usually notice about me is that i'm there.
surprise! yes, i exist. did someone drape an invisibility cloak
over me, or what.<br />
<br />
people say they're surprised when they finally start to ""get"" who i
am after knowing me for a while. and then it's ""oh, you're actually
kind of cool.""<br />
<br />
people also often say i'm ""cute."" bah. what about womanly! ...oh
well. so i'm cute."
my explosive creativity! :) :) :)
"i've been told my smile. i like my eyes, though."
""
""
is that i really listen.
"i dunno, maybe my wry sense of humor? i don't over-sell myself. but
i do have great legs."
"i'm genuine and friendly, maybe a little shy/quiet at first."
""
i say the word bag funny.
my smile and my optimistic demeanor!
my energy. and my curly hair.
"all of me. i tend to stand out in just about any environment as
i'm<br />
usually more outspoken than most, and am comfortable in most
any<br />
situation from business meetings to social gatherings."
that i'm noticing you back.
""
"i truly have no idea. i've been told i have a pretty poor grasp of
the impression i make on people, generally.<br />
<br />
however, some helpful quotes include: a) from many more than one
person, that i am crazy and at the same time the sanest person they
know. b) most memorably a workshop leader at esalen turning to the
group and saying: ""there's not a lot of mileage on her."" thk u, i
think. c) pretty wonderfully, that i am magic, and wild. i can't
bend spoons with the power of my mind, but i sure can make things
happen for the people i care about. and there is something feral,
not girls gone wild, but something that tells me i am outside of
the box--probably because i could never find the bloody box. don't
misunderstand me: it is not that i chose to reject the box. i
believe the box rejected me. and i still say the box could have
left me a note saying as much. but it did not. i am not bitter."
"i often carry a dead cat around my neck so the smell sometimes
precedes me."

hmmm... most people's first question is what's my nationality.
""
i'm not sure lol
"not really sure looks wise i get the most compliments on my hair.
everyone tells me i'm easy to talk to when first meeting me."

"hmm...well best guess, i'd have to say my smile since that is
something people actually tell me when they meet me. i've never
heard anyone say, for instance, ""gee, your forearms are so well
defined."" ;-)"
this question weirds me out.
"maybe my accent. sometimes people don't know this particular irish
lilt. french is definitely my favorite mistaken identity."
"people usually tell me: i look 23, i am calm, i have a lot of
stories to tell, i am patient, i'm hard to figure out/full of
surprises, i don't fit in a box."
"probably that i'm quiet, it takes me a while to warm up to new
people, after that, i'm not so quiet."

"well when you first meet me i am quite then after a while i let my
cray cray self out and we end up having a blast with whatever we
are doing."
"that i'm passionate about what i do, am not afraid to tell it

hair? smile? you tell me ;)
"a lot of people tell me i look a lot younger than my age, which
means more when it comes from people i work with who find out my
age and act genuinely shocked - a good and equally bad reaction...

recently that i look exactly like my photos, so no smoke &amp;

"...really depends very much on them in that moment, and on the
circumstances.<br />
<br />
i don't ever ask this question, because the answers have
embarrassed me in the past. however if i had to guess, i would say
that they perhaps notice my mood, or energy, or feelings. i see
myself as not being inclined to conceal my thoughts or intentions
or emotions -even if i don't readily speak of them. it is fair to
say that i have a shitty poker face. i have a hard time not
intimating what's going on. i can, but it takes considerable
effort."

my smile and probably my sense of style.
"probably my french accent. according to my roommate, it's ""pretty
damn strong"" even though lots of people can't place a country on
it."
"my hair, super curly, used to go down my back but has since fallen
prey to a recent familial hairdresser.<br />

punchy... i like to call it my voice of reason. i'm a good listener

texas (it's because i grew up as an expat kid)"

my laugh or my smile. i laugh and smile a lot.

"hm, accent, i guess (i'm trying! :-) the good part of it is that
the (natural) usual subsequent question is a good ice-breaker."
"my eyebrows and my awkwardness. though that awkwardness can vary
depending on the setting, i'm usually fairly awkward around new
people. otherwise most people probably notice that i'm talking far
too quickly for someone born and (mostly) raised in the south.
also, the absence of an accent."
"well when i was younger i looked like roger daltry, so much so
people would take photo's, i had long hair then. i was actually
shocked when i saw ""tommy""<br />

a dirty joke as i walked past him."
"smile? not that it's good, i just can't stop smiling. sometimes
people ask my why i'm smiling. doesn't merit a response ever.
physically speaking, people tend to notice my eyes i guess. i
myself notice my legs but i guess i don't count here"

italian accent is pretty noticeable"
i make people feel at ease. either that or my curls.

effortlessly funny.<br />

shia labeouf. topanga, where you at?<br />

personality wise, they usually notice that i'm a pretty laid back,
down-to-earth guy with a good sense of humor."

intense; i'm okay with that."

often unmanaged. and my style, i incorporate a lot of different

seriously. the phrase ""tmi"" is hardly in my vocabulary.<br />
i laugh a lot, am very talkative, energetic, sarcastic, witty,
flirtatious, and love to keep you on your toes. i like playful
banter so you better have good come-backs! i'm also not your
typical 'girl'.<br />
<br />
i hate leaving anything unfinished and since i am a perfectionist,
i will work tirelessly to make sure everything is done to the best
of my ability.<br />

it is important to me that everyone is enjoying themselves. i was
raised by my parents to be an indefinite host. i can only relax
when i've made sure everyone is having fun.<br />

"difficult to say, but almost everyone who has known me for more
than a few minutes knows i'm very sarcastic."
"might not be the first thing people notice but this seems like a
good opportunity to mention it anyway; the nonconsensual body mod
on the right side of my face was given to me by a german shephard

is that i'm macgyver.
sideburns...or my nice teeth
"okay, i have no idea what the first thing is that people notice
about me, but there seems to be a strange consensus amongst folks
who have known me even for a little while. the frequent adjective
that i've heard used to describe me is ""awesome"". i'm a bit
self-conscious about including that here, but... well... i've heard
it a few times from different people, so there must be some merit
to it."

hitman"". okay, fair enough."

trying... haha. i'm a very friendly and light-hearted person who
loves to joke around but knows when to be serious as well"
my hair. my laugh. my humor. what you see is what you get.
my laugh.
"what won't you notice? i'm not what you'd call shy. i've been known
to be brash and am usually pretty crass (but know when to reign it
in). even my skin has something to say. after all, i grew up in new
york and i was in the restaurant industry (read: cooking, not
serving) for a while. sf has helped to soften my edge a little
though, so please don't be too scared. it only hurts for a minute
and then it feels real good, i promise.<br />
<br />
also, apparently i am highly entertaining to be around. whatever
the hell that means."
"usually my height and voice i think. i used to woo all the old
church lady's back when i was a young lad."
"well, thanks to my goofball friend who set up this account for me,
most okcupid folks usually notice my unfortunate username before
anything else... but since okcupid wants me to ""go a-list"" to
change it - which requires money - i'm ""stuck"" with this (so to
speak). thanks, goofball friend.<br />
<br />
for the record: i would prefer an okcupid username that involved
neither electromagnetism nor testicles. then i could answer this
question in the spirit it was asked, instead of feeling compelled
to offer a disclaimer. really: thank you, goofball friend."
what?
i am likely darker than you.
"that i gesture like crazy, i hardly knew until a friend sneakily
filmed it."
"probably my calm, even-tempered voice. i've been told it's quite
soothing -- apparantly soothing enough to put more than one student
to sleep."
"physically? probably that i'm petite. i've also been told i have a
nice smile"
my joker smile and warmth that is with out judgement.
"probably that i'm male. however, since that's a supremely useless
commentary on who i am i'll go with the fact that i can get kind of
hyper and weird. or maybe it's the fact that i keep my hair super
short (people think i'm a military guy all the time)."

"i've recently been told the following: big happy eyes, great smile,
confidence, freckles, and open mind. and a few other things you
might have to find out for yourself."
my laugh. friends can locate me from afar just by listening for it.
"my head, i keep it shaved if i can because when there's hair up
there it annoys me. recently people have been complimenting me on
my body, but i have to exercise everyday or so because i'm in the
national guard. most people smile or laugh when i'm around, so i
guess i'm funny."
my red hair and/or the fact that i cuss like a sailor.
"people's first impression of me is usually that i am mean or a
bitch, or they think i don't like them and they are immediately
offended by this. my best friend of 10 years hated me the first
year that we knew each other because i was the only person in our
class at college that didn't laugh at one of her jokes; it wasn't
funny. anyway, i am not a bitch; as i said at the beginning of this
profile, i am just reserved when it comes to meeting new people.
when i was young, i was downright shy- i wouldn't call myself shy
nowadays...perhaps introverted at times. regardless, this trait
often gets misinterpreted for snobbery or bitchiness."
teeth. eyes. nose.
i've been told i have a unique laugh.
"my eyes -- the color of the deepest ocean. yes, that was sarcastic,
but yes, it is true! i have beautiful eyeballs. oftentimes, you'll
hear me before you see me, though. i'm a little loud and a little
unruly."

then later....my sarcastic sense of humor and how i like to make
people laugh."
"i'm a pretty reflective person. i like to stare off into space and
think."
"i'm not really sure, as i'm not people. if i were still in
philadelphia i'd say people notice me showing southern hospitality,
but here in california holding the door open doesn't get you weird
looks."
"my laugh (it is distinctive, but in a good way, at least i hope),
my eyes (no, they aren't different colors and no, one of them is
not a glass eye)."
"are my quirky glasses, shoes, or the fact that i'm wearing too many
different colors."
it depends on the people.
"hmmmm, that is a good question. i guess eyes."
my shaved head?
my smile i suppose?

"because they all decided to call me ""pinocchio teacher,"" i think if
you were to ask the oh-so-subtle korean kids whom i was trying and
generally failing to teach english a couple years ago, they'd say
that my prominent nose is my most defining feature. but for anyone
who is not a nine-year-old korean esl student and has a passing
familiarity with italian and/or semitic features, hopefully it's my
endearing smile or winning personality that you'll notice
first.<br />

that, or the crazy groucho marx eyebrows.<br />

as well - throws people off - i often get, ""so...what are you?"" i
am then entertained by the around-the-world guesses of my
ethnicity. guys often approach me at the gym and tell me i don't
smile enough. maybe that's just a pick up line? i mean really, i'm

like...ive heard them all lol :)"
"my devious grin! then, likely my boobs... ; )"
"i get a lot of initial compliments about my eyes, smile, and
friendliness. if you get to know me a little better, perhaps you'd
add passion, playfulness, and sassy sense of humor."
"that my <a href=""http://www.giveforward.com/lilliput"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dog</a> and i are both redheads. i'm more auburn to
lilliput's strawberry blonde."
my blue eyes. and my massive goiter.
my eyes

told i am very entertaining."
"my smile, eyes or boobs."
"is that i'm a guy, then that i'm asian."

stop me on the way cause i could talk all night about whatever
subject we are taking about. ha! ha!"
my new haircut...all my friends have the same haircut.

"those slow-mo scenes of people walking toward the camera (usually a
group of renegade former law enforcement officers or some sort of
military team)? that's how i move all the time. years of practice
and self-discipline. and wind machines.<br />
<br />
so, yeah. it gets noticed."
"my abundance of curly hair, my eyes, or my one dimple.<br />
<br />
that i'm genuine, that i'm down-to-earth. what you see is pretty
much what you get."
my height. my hats. my teeth.
i have long eyelashes. i smile a lot.

originally from il), my curiousity, my adventurous heart...maybe my
eyes and that i'm genuine."
my happy face :)

positive energy<br />
mischievous nature"
"my third eye (i've decided not to feel self-conscious about it any
longer),<br />
my unruly curls,<br />
my joie de vivre (which is quite distinct from being chipper. my
hearty joy of living is based on what is true in the moment, which
is not always jolly. i will gladly go into the deeper, darker stuff
with you even if i have just met you)<br />
my wit."
my congeniality
my laugh or my eyelashes
"i'm funny, i remind them of somebody and they've never met anybody
who deals with maps for a living. can be a bit of a sour puss when
it comes to san francisco. this is only because i've never been
anywhere where people are so uniformly in mad love with the city
they inhabit."
"my height. they always ask ""wow, you are so tall, do you play
basketball?"" my response is ""no, you are short, do you play
miniature golf?"" :)<br />

my ability to listen, and my smile."
"my sense of humor and ability to adapt to new situations. super
green eyes..."
"my height, my curly hair.... and honestly my teeth. a lot of people

for paying for them and myself - for wearing my retainer every
night til i was 20. :)"

"actually, i don't usually ask. they usually don't notice that i'm
hysterically funny till much later.<br />
<br />
side note, if you agree that the fewer people that get the joke,
the funnier the joke is --- well i take this comedic philosophy to
a deep level."

they notice.. you're just gonna have to find out for yourself ;)"

the other person, it will be hard to shut me up."
"it turns out... i'm short. you know that ""growing"" thing that most
people do? yeahhh i didn't do that.<br />
<br />
oh and apparently its very clear that i'm not from the west coast.
i guess i'm not cutting it with my lack of tattoos and non-dyed
hair."
my smile. my positive attitude. my guitar.
that they can't place my accent
"that i look older than i actually am. i blame the facial hair, but
in all honesty i don't like the way i look without it. during the
stanley cup playoffs season, i basically turn into an italian
lumberjack as i grow my playoff beard for my sharks.<br />

i never asked that question...
my smile.
"people think i come across reserved and laid back when the first
meet me but they also will see my inquisitiveness come through. i
enjoying learning about new people and love asking tons of
questions to get to know them."
"i'm really tall. being asked ""do you play basketball"" your entire
life, especially by strangers on the street and in elevators, is a
great reminder to duck when you walk into busses, bart, through
door jams, etc. i tried to buy a jacket in a department store in
china and the salesclerk told me that i was too tall, and that i
was inefficient. also, people in china routinely stopped on the
street and stared at me like i was an escapee from the zoo.
awkward. :)"

rapunzel-esque hair. unless i'm driving, then its my 1974 thing."

i have an expressive face but don't take my word for it.
my humor
"either my ethnicity, or they think that i look too white and
couldn't be mixed with anything else. but it seems like when i'm in
la i become mexican."
""
"i've been told i have kind eyes. beyond that i've never actually
asked what people notice about me. i should start asking that."
"i really enjoy conversing with strangers, so they probably wonder
why i am bothering them?"
"my interesting sense of style and my large olive green eyes.<br />
<br />
i remind everyone of the girl with the dragon tattoo.<br />

i am pretty friendly if i'm in an okay mood and you're nice to me!

my butt is fantastic.<br />

i usually get compliments about my eyes or my hair. it usually goes
like this:<br />

""are those your real eyes?""<br />
or<br />
""is that all your real hair?"""
maybe that i look younger than i am.
more info arriving shortly
"probably that i am short and that i generally leave a memorable
impression."
"i guess people notice a few things like my curly blonde hair, my
height or that i tend to smile and laugh a lot."
"that depends on the person, i guess."
"my height. i'm half dutch, after all"
humorous and creepy.
"my short stature, probably my membership card to the itty bitty
titty committee.... my favorite boots."
"i'm quite reserved, so the first thing people notice about me is
that it's not that easy to get to know me, but if they give me a
chance, they see that i'm more than worth the try."

vigorous yet silky dancing."

very fun to be with and that i'm a very good listener."
"i think people usually notice my energy. from what i'm told.. and
from what i guess i'm beginning to recognize.. i have a strong
presence. if i'm pissed off, the whole room will sense my upset. it
makes things awkward. on the same token, if i'm happy and open..
which is the case the majority of the time.. everything takes on a
sparkle. people really feel me.. which means it's important for me
to monitor how i'm feeling and how i'm presenting myself.<br />
<br />
people also notice my smile. apparently it's captivating. i think
that goes along with the whole having strong energy thing.<br />
<br />
the way i carry myself, the way i dress, the way i talk, the words
i use.. it's all impacting."

i need to trim my bangs.

amazing. then, people make fun of my iphone. and then they ask to

people to figure out my ethnicity because i have blue eyes, tan
skin, and dark hair."

am from: canadian? russia? holland? spain? ireland? no, peru!"
the koala in my baby bjorn

they are showing."

talk to and easy to get a few easy laughs...nothing too heavy at
first...i am curious...are you?"

know!"
they notice my big smile :)
"well, it must be my accent or something, because everywhere i go i
always get asked the same question: ""where r u from?"""

skin and confident."

my height and build, 6'2 about 216, love the gym"

probably one of the first things people notice about me. but once i
get to know you, i am extremely friendly!"
my smile and my eyes.
my smile and my hair.

like to ask me for directions."

accent."

they thought, and got this list: kindness, intelligence, humor,
curiosity, creativity, honesty, cool t-shirts, nice eyes, and a
nice smile."

boston and almost every day somebody i come into contact with says
""you're not from san francisco, where are you from-boston?"" i never
realized my accent was so profound until i came to sf. i am always
very positive. i have a no care in the world attitude. i think
people notice quickly that i am a true gentleman, especially since
here in sf the guys don't even get up to let girls/woman sit in the
seats on the muni-bus, very strange to me? i have an attitude that
if i can just make a difference in at least one persons life each
day (even a small positive influence) then i will be happy. i want
to feel complete and satisfied and i spend a lot of my time
thinking about how i can reach that goal..."

maintained a large vocabulary of southern isms (which can be
hilarious if you think about them in the literal sense).."

about it here. my guess is that i'm a tall, pale, and much nerdier
than i appear."

pogo stick (doorways suck by the way)."

than my photos. and that i ask a lot of questions to get to know
you."

3, on scale of 1 to 10."

when i'm out having an adventure -- whether hiking in the
wilderness, trying strange food, or going on an impromptu road
trip. i'm also open to the kind of adventures that don't involve
leaving the house."
"i dress pretty well for a straight boy, i can be a little reserved
until i am comfortable, then i never shut up.<br />
<br />
i try to remain idealistic and ethical while not taking myself too
seriously. the world will never be perfect, all we can do is play
our part and fight the good fight. the story never changes, only
the players."

"my height - 6'1"", i reportedly smell good, my occasional
sarcasm...."

people i don't like. i am really wam and caring with people that i

glasses. my sense of humor. my lack of italian accent. my heated
spirit. my forthcoming nature and sexuality. my generosity,
especially when i'm in the states, for some reason (and i'm not
even a great tipper, go figure!).<br />
and yes, to be honest, my boobs, which is not always cool depending
on the deliverance."

unless i trip, then people tend to notice that i'm endearingly
clumsy. at least i tell myself that it's endearing..."

smile but most seem to notice my glasses before anything else."
"that i always wear a hat. i don't know why, but i just can't leave
the house without first putting on a hat. it's probably because i
hate my hair. promise me you won't tell my hair stylist. lol"

outbursts, and my obvious body odor (lilac and sandalwood).<br />

voice."

italian heritage!)."

arms but that is a guess."

"i'm tall (just san francisco tall, not dutch tall) and have the
phenotypic incongruity of brown hair with blue eyes, whereas most
blue-eyed women bleach their hair as blonde as possible. a lot of
brown-eyed women do this too, but i've always thought it makes them
look like golden retrievers."
people have told me i have nice eyebrows and strong hands.

positive most of the time."
my cheekbones.
""
"i like to laugh and have a smile on my face about 95% of the time
so that is what most people notice right off the bat. i like to
have a good time and do things/be with people that i really enjoy
every single day. life is too short to be miserable."

a little sarcasm?
i'm a special snowflake
"eyes, smile.. and i'm a little quiet at first"
"beside my height (i'm 6-4)...probably that i'm very outgoing. i
enjoy meeting new people and finding out about them; i'm very
inquisitive...i ask a lot of questions."
honestly?
i smile a lot.

true. just think of the money i could be making..."

though it's winter."
i'm very outgoing and make friends with just about anybody
"not gonna lie...women notice my hair, men notice my boobs. it's
just how it is. yes...you will probably say the hair was noticed
first...but if there is a cleavage shot up we both know that is a
straight up lie.<br />
<br />
the most common non-physical compliment i get is that i am
exceedingly patient. i often have to diffuse crazy situations and
deal with people who need very special attention, so it shows a
lot.<br />
<br />
as far as the boobs go...to quote the seinfeld episode ""yes they
are real...and they are spectacular!""."
that i'm asian
i'm sincere
"my weird facial expressions. one time i was hanging out with some
friends in irvine and a random guy comes up to our group and tells
me that he could not get over my facial expressions. i think he was
drunk, but now i try to be more concious of it. not working out
though."
""
"probably my calf implants, they are sexy as hell. i'll send you a
picture for $10 bucks if you'd like."
either my smile or my boyish charm.
they either think i'm a bitch or totally awesome.
the first thing i notice is that people notice me when i enter.
my looks?
i just don't know.
"i feel like most people judge the cover at first. once they get a
moment with me gears always seem to shift. its like people don't
get me at first. it's all good because i am completely honest and
sometimes can be an open book. i am pretty outgoing."
"that i'm the shortest dude in the room but stand taller than the
rest. zing!"
my beautiful smile jaja!

people are just overwhelmed by the luxuriousness and gleaming
appeal of my locks. presently, it is short and has some blue in it."

"one of my first bosses out of school, a former cnn reporter/anchor,
told me that i have presence. it may be my big smile and laugh,
voice, abundant energy, or as my gf's call it--my ""runway walk."""
my eyes are two different colors.
"i honestly don't know what people notice first about me. but one
thing i notice about <em>other</em> people is scent -- not so much
b.o. (but if you smell like a bum on muni, i won't be onboard with
that) -- but if someone's wearing too much perfume. i'm really
sensitive to that. it can give me a headache and make me sneeze
profusely. i don't think people who wear perfumes and colognes
realize how much they're wearing and that it's effectively a trail
pheromone. i'm also into hypo-allergenic, non-scented soaps and
detergents."
"i think everyone on here kinda hates this question, let's be real."
my eyes.
"it'd probably be my smile because i'm <em>always</em> smiling.
either that or my voice because i tend to be rather loud (if you're
happy and you know it, you better show it!)"
"i get comments like i'm so fun to be around/funny/love to smile,
pleasant, sweet &amp; approachable."
"my eyes, my smile, and that i am light-hearted. although i have had
two friends tell me lately that i look ""intense"" since i just cut
my hair pretty short."
"my dog, oscar (he's pretty adorable)."
"although i've never asked, i would guess my beard or the fact that
my shoes are usually untied."
that totally depends on what they are interested in.

and even gold. my smile, and.. my calves apparently ?"

""
"do physical qualities really make a man? i want to be remembered as
""the one who always made me smile and laugh""."
is my endearing and heartfelt demeanor.
my bright big smile:)
i really have no idea. maybe you can tell me when we meet?
"generally, i'm always smiling and having fun. i'm also very
thoughtful and considerate. that's usually what sticks with people
about me."
""
i'm tall
"nice, interesting, friendly, wise and easy going."
good question. i'll need someone else's input on this one.
""
"sense of humor, my big smile, the fact that i'm of irish descent,
that i'm an improviser/someone who is not afraid to drop an accent
or funny voice into a conversation."
"in sf, my year around tan."
i smile a lot and i'm a nerd. my piercings and tattoos.
"the warm, loving energy that i put out. also, unfortunately i find
that in our society people typically only notice my appearance. i'm
not attracted to someone's appearance as much as their mind, and i
appreciate the same from men. (read: when you message me just to
comment on my physical appearance, i think you're a pig.) also, i
have a lot of inner strength (i'm a scorpio, people) so people
notice that and are sometimes intimidated by it. you shouldn't be,
though, because i'm very friendly and warm!"

my clothes (quite odd at times) or my eyes i think

tall dude that excels at the random number generation art.

"my smile, mohawk &amp; stature."
that i'm friendly and get along with most everyone.
"physically:<br />
1. i'm short<br />
2. i'm filipina<br />
3. i smile &amp; laugh a lot<br />
<br />
after talking to me for a bit, people notice that:<br />
1. i'm a pervert and turn everything into a dirty joke<br />
2. i laugh at almost everything<br />
3. i have a very broad and random range of things that interest
me<br />
4. i'm a major geek<br />
5. i'm ridiculously honest and open and have no filter."

you see it.<br />

the scattered knitting needles, yarn, scissors, and measuring tape."

"hey you look like that girl who used to have a giant mohawk, is
what i've been getting since i shaved my head. really this is a
loaded question how would i know what someone would notice about
me??? i don't know what you're into."
i have to ask them:)
my smile and my awesome collection of nerdy t-shirts.
""
"my glasses. yup, i have them. they help me see."
""
my long eyelashes... nope they aren't fake!
my eyes

how unusually tall i am for a female."

my voice.
my eyes are bigger than average asian eyes
"blue eyes and burly good looks...<br />
or that i've been drinking=-p"
don't know yet but looking forward to finding out.
red hair.
"the pieces of metal hanging out of my face, also known as my
piercings.<br />
<br />
that i walk on my tip-toes. i prefer the phrase ""like a raptor""
instead."
"my keys. i usually carry enough to make a janitor jealous. in my
defense i use each key almost daily, and i find the jingle-jangle
to be a nice soundtrack to my personal stride. my eyes aren't too
shabby either."
i prefer to let other people answer this one!
"long eyelashes. don't pull them to see if they're real.<br />
smile. people have told me my eyes alone can smile brighter than
entire faces do. well, you be the judge."
i'm talkative!
"my laugh. if i really get , snorting is induced, which tends to
make others snort that never knew they snorted."
"i'm really small, people point that out a lot. like i had no idea
and they're clueing me in"
"my eyes, smile, hair, and tattoos."
""

"my expressive eyes. intensity. confidence. intelligence. sense of
humor."
my smile ;)
"rude and unfriendly (most of my friends said it is because of my
face, wish i can change easily to suit all of you),
straightforward, honest.. well that's why am happy to have my small
circle of friends as they got through the first thing judgement
about me"
"i'm super-friendly and easy to talk to, smart, confident but nice."

"the suit and tie...i stick out like a sore thumb on the bus.
probably also that i laugh a lot, or that i have a squint eye when
i drink ;-)"
""
"my smile, my heart.... hopefully not one through the other."
"my smile, that is when i smile. i'm not the type of person that
smiles all the time for absolutely no reason, i don't want to look
like some sort of crazy person. one other thing that people
probably notice about me is my hair. anything else i will leave to
the imagination, or you can tell me if we ever meet."
"i laugh a lot. cheesy answer, i know, but it's what i got"
my height. kinda hard to miss that.
""
my wild ginger hair? i guess? sure.
"that i smell nice. at least i hope so, i spend an embarrassing
amount of money on perfume."
my glasses probably.

my smile.
"my eyes<br />
outgoing, playfullness<br />
sensitivity<br />
compassion, kindness"
"recently? my lips. and my nose piercing. also, whatever book i'm
reading; although this may be due to the fact that people actually
are curious about that sort of thing."
my boundless energy
"my fine musculature. admittedly, it's hard to see after a quick run
through the meat grinder, but hey, true beauty lies within. i also
taste wonderful with ketchup."
"i don't look my age. i light up when i laugh, and usually something
about my energy."

see for yourself.
bangs?

intelligent conversations with people on a wide variety of
subjects."
"i seem to be both always smiling and always squinting in photos :p
it's not just the ones i posted, it's like every photo ever taken
of me."
my dreds
"well if we're being truthful.. my teeth. they are said to be very
white... i swear i don't use whitener."
"my hair, my eyes, my smile, my build, my humor, my intellect, and
my thoughtfulness."
"the first thing they notice is that i'm short of stature. that
phase lasts about 30 seconds. then they notice that i'm oddly
quiet, but intense. this may last awhile. they may notice that i'm
bad at small talk. eventually, if they stick around they'll find me
extremely valuable to have in their life."
usually people comment on my smile and eyes
my dimples :)
"how small and ""mouse like"" i am."
"height, eyes?"
"my electric blue trench coat. i love that thing. (it makes me feel
like inspector gadget.)"

supposed to know like the html color code for it or something?
haha. it's just red!"
my laugh
you tell me. :)
"my long gypsy-like hair, and my *fake* accent. i can't tell you how
many people 2nd guess if my british accent is real. since i've been
in the us for several years now, it comes in &amp; out (that's what
she said)."
i'm very tall and blonde.
"either my eyebrows or the weird ducktail i get in my hair. then
usually the foul things coming out of my mouth."

occasional michael jackson thrust or gracefully swaying about to
the best of ella &amp; louie."
my strange first name and my faint foreign accent.
my smile :-)
my infectious laugh :)
i'm approachable.
my hair? eyes? height? curves? dk....my caring yet outspoken nature
"dude, i don't know."
"it used to be the hair until i mowed it off but i would have to say
the dimples ever since i could remember, its always been about
those indents in my cheeks. i think its because i do smile more
than the average person. not those fake smiles either. smiling is
all in the eyes."
"either that i am funny/sarcastic, or that i am totally insulting
followed by the realization that i am just a nice guy, who at times
doesn't communicate in the most delicate ways.<br />
<br />
when i am in a reserved mood ... maybe it is my loud laugh? my big
nose? something i'm totally unaware of?"
