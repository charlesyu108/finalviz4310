mountain bike (we are so lucky!). the only bad thing about these is
if you sit home on a weekend you really have to feel guilty for not
going someplace amazing.<br />

"<strong>music</strong><br />
silence disturbs me. music moves me. the absence of motion is
unsettling.<br />
<br />
<strong>fiction</strong><br />
i'd normally single out 'anime' or 'games', but the truth is i just
want to have some fiction to fall into. it doesn't have to be a
grand sweeping epic, it can be simple and fun; it doesn't matter,
as long as there's something to experience and explore.<br />
<br />
<strong>companionship</strong><br />
i don't consider myself extroverted, nor do i consider myself
introverted. all the same, being all alone is a frightening,
frightening thought. i often get depressed when there's absolutely
no one in the house except myself.<br />
<br />
<strong>art</strong><br />
this might file under the 'fiction' section, but it has more to do
with my own ability to create art rather than to experience it. as
mentioned above, i love to create. it comes together with the other
entries above: i love to absorb fiction, coalesce them into
thought, create art, and share my creations with people.<br />
<br />
<strong>humor</strong><br />
i don't consider myself a dreadfully serious person. i love to
laugh, because... well, who doesn't?<br />
<br />
<strong>erotica</strong><br />
it's worth mentioning a second time that i am notoriously
perverted. i'm proud of my sexuality and make no secret of it. call
me shallow if you must, but i idolize beauty and i don't hold
myself back with some false sense of 'maturity'. if i think it's
sexy, i'll call it as i see it."

myself, and don't try convincing me it wasn't fault because only i
know the circumstances of his death and the underlying root causes.
it was my fault. but he is in a better place now. i believe,
contrary to some popular religious teachings than animals can have
a soul. they are granted these souls when a human gives them a
same, such as ""fluffy"". this is why you don't name your food
animals people! solves that whole problem quite conveniently.
anyway, i am rambling again... down to 1 kitteh, and he's in charge
now and he knows it. don't f*** with the opiemeister."

"1. books -- there's not enough time that can be allotted to
reading, in my opinion. i have three bookshelves in my bedroom if
that gives you any idea.<br />
<br />
2. meditation/yoga -- this is a recent regular addition to my life,
and i'm already addicted. i absorb a lot of stress, so this is just
great for giving my mind and body a real break.<br />
<br />
3. the city -- as much as i dream about having my own alpaca ranch,
i can't really imagine living outside of a city again. the suburbs
scarred me growing up, and i really feel that they are a lot of
what is wrong with the direction of the world today. so far i've
lived in nyc, sf, and sydney, australia. i'm likely settled in san
francisco, but i would love to live short-term in other cities
when/if i have a lifestyle that would allow me today that.<br />
<br />
4. family (including my friends that are family) -- i really don't
know what i would do without them. probably crawl into a ditch
somewhere. i'm lucky to have some of the most amazing family
members i could possibly have. they're so great that they/we often
adopt our friends.<br />
<br />
5. animals -- wild or domesticated. if i were to develop some sort
of adult-onset allergies, for example, that prevented me from
working with animals, i would probably go into a deep depression.
there is plenty of evidence that says how humans treat animals is
directly correlated to how humans treat other humans. serial
killers usually start by killing animals, and domestic abusers
almost always abuse the family pet, too. i feel my rapport with
animals is a gift, and i can use it to help people understand and
live in harmony with their pets and other animals, which will in
turn contribute to a more peaceful society. i have this thing about
being the butterfly who flaps her wings to start the ripple, if you
catch my metaphor.<br />

do a single thing without it. it feeds me the ability to keep
going.<br />

swore to never do that again. it was too depressing.<br />

3. caffeine. i've had plenty of speeches about too much being bad
for you and every possible negative point whether it be truly
backed by science or not. like hell that's gonna stop me. i can't
even find the right words to express my love and dependency on it.
i need caffeine and it needs me.<br />

4. chocolate. i am a lady. we need this stuff. enough said.<br />

5. internet. for one thing, it's where i work. no internet, no
paycheck. and that's just not something i can live with. other than
that fact i'd like to see anyone my age survive without internet.
give it a few days tops and we go nuts.<br />
<br />
6. stubbornness. seems like something other people could do without
me having but its essential for me. life's been rough as hell and
hope isn't something i really go for anymore. all it does is just
lull you into a false sense of security before the next obstacle
snipes you between the eyes. but i'm too stubborn to quit now.
there's a lot of life left in this stumpy body of mine and i'm not
about to let go just yet. we're not fucking done here."

culinary school and the friends and coworkers i have made in the
food service industry have been helping me develop a fine palate
;d<br />
3. warmth. the sun or an embrace. cuddling with a partner or laying
awake on a hot summer night. runnin around on the pavement with no
shoes on and burning the soles of my feet. in most situations i
would prefer the heat. sweat? bring it on.<br />
4. ganja. keeps me sane.<br />
5. creativity and expression. i'm talking about music, art, and how
i like to decorate my body. my physical being is my own canvas to
treat how i desire. i enjoy using my hands to create practical
peices of art and the fun, impractical peices of art which take up
time and or space. all in an effort to direct my energy into a
positive outlet.<br />

to choose a favorite, it would be nerds.....or maybe gummy

never fall because my proprioception is so impeccable. or does the
fact that i trip every day mean it is bad?<br />

industry and i take a great amount of pleasure in distinguishing
notes as i taste and learning about new techniques and producers. a
long term goal of mine is to have a house in sonoma or napa with
some vines i can mess around with. which brings me to...<br />
5. weekends in the north bay. another of best things about being in
san francisco is the ability to cross a bridge and be in a gorgeous
recreational playground where you can hike, kayak, wine taste,
picnic and have a little break from the city. i take full advantage
and i'm sorry i didn't start that when i was in high school.<br />

stretching yoga. it makes me a better person - seriously. 3) work -
i go stir crazy really easily, i like keeping busy. this could be
work at an office, on my tea business, on my personal development,
just working on something. 4) really good hugs from friends, and
especially from children. kids give the best hugs. 5) that marathon
phone call with my best friend once a week. it grounds me. 6)
travel - i grew up knowing who i was by taking myself ""out of

a 450-600 page book in a day if i'm intrigued by it. colleagues
have been known to hold conversations with me while staring at the
covers of the book. i can multi-track so it's not exactly a

couldn't do without. in light of this, i'll still try and answer
this more or less seriously, things that i really am very grateful
to have and would be disappointed to not have (happy?)<br />
<br />
1. my sense of humor. i think im kinda weird in the things i like,
and well...i kinda like that. for example if you like the song tgif
by katy perry you'll notice at the end of the video the father says
kitty kat we invented fridays. on occasion i use this phrase when
talking to people.<br />
2. my extreme sexiness. you think im joking or full of myself but
that just aint so little lady...i used to be fat and love that i
decided to not be. (note: khloe kardashian if you are reading this
lets talk i used to be just like you)<br />
3. brazilian jiu jitsu. its fun to wrestle w hot sweaty dudes, what
can i say?<br />
4. being hairy. just because i was convinced by the world that it
was terrible for so long and now i can use it both as a tool of
seduction (by grabbing your face and rubbing it in my chest) or as
a weapon (also by grabbing your face and rubbing it in my chest).
either way im a champion.<br />
5. being a smart nerd. another thing i used to hide. i left my
nerdish ways for years only to realize its who i am and that my
well developed nerdish smartness combined with my keenly developed
sense of awesomeness makes for a better-than-clark-kent-superman
double identity<br />
6. smiling. i was once told i was a really good smiler."

omelettes, the internet, interesting conversations.<br />

(not necessarily ""never"", but i would go crazy without them)."

cuddling with my friends and knowing all of my friends on an

makes them better. <b>i love knowing people's victories, virtues
and vices.</b><br />

<b>sense of touch</b>: go ahead and giggle at this next statement.
<b>i like to touch people.</b> now that that's out of the way, i'll
explain. it's very obvious throughout my profile that i love human
contact, we all need it after all, and i feel best when i can
cuddle and lay against someone for long periods of time, hold
hands, or be touching someone i care for, friend or otherwise. be
it friendly touch or lustful touch, i love it. there's no greater
feel than to be able to lay with someone run your fingers along
their skin. try it sometime.<br />
<br />
<b>sex(uality)</b>: like i said earlier, i'm not a perpetually
horny individual, but it's definitely a clear streak in my daily
life. i enjoy good sex, just like any reasonable person, and i also
enjoy sexuality itself, and all the subjects that surround it.
there's no harm in fun between consenting adults. ;d<br />

lonely.<br />

-squat &amp; gobble. there is a chain of places in san francisco
called squat &amp; gobble.... don't tell me that isn't
intentional.<br />
<br />
-i think it would be hilarious if really fat guys started doing the
shirtless-mirror shot... and duck-lips.<br />
<br />
-women complain about men not reading their profile, but almost
every woman who emails me seems surprised, 4 emails in, when she
learns i don't live in sf.<br />
<br />
-wow... james bond is really kinda rapey.<br />
<br />
-if women only knew how attractive men find it when they eat a
lot... no man wants a dainty eater.<br />
<br />
-it just occurred to me: the golden idol, that indiana jones is
retrieving at the beginning of raiders of the lost ark, is in a
heavily booby-trapped temple, surrounded by native tribesmen who
bow to the idol and will kill for it... indy isn't recovering an
artifact for a museum, he is robbing a tribe of indigenous people
of their chief possession... damn.<br />
<br />
-the reason the bourne identity is bullshit is because no guy would
be that disappointed to find out he is a secret agent.<br />
<br />
-""i like women who aren't afraid to check me if i get a little out
of line. i want a woman i am intimidated by... just a little
bit...""<br />
<br />
-don't tell me you are ""adventurous"" if you aren't actually willing
to go out and find random adventure at a moments notice at 11 on a
monday night. i know you have work tomorrow. we all do. but its
worth the sleep deprivation to have a story that you will remember

"1. good food: cheese, noodles, spicy things, olive oil and chai.
the kitchen is my refuge on a bad day and my place of worship on a
good one.<br />
<br />
2. faith: its not so much about faith in god as it is about faith
in people. that the community will take care of each other, that
people will always do the right thing. the faith of trying to see
the best in people. this is why i love being jewish- we take care
of each other.<br />
<br />
3. internet: i love learning and having access to information. i
hate to admit it, but my iphone is glued to my hand. wikipedia and
youtube are the best things ever.<br />
<br />
4. communication: i don't like to lead people on or assume that we
are on the same page. i will always be honest and expect the
same.<br />
<br />
5. friends and family: i love the support network of friends and
family that i have. they have my back and i have theirs. they are
always the ones who will be there for you, or give you the cold
slap of reality when you're acting some kind of bat-shit
crazy.<br />
<br />
6. music: my tastes vary quite widely, but i love music and
singing. it has always been and will always be a part of my
life.<br />
<br />
six (nerdy) things that didn't make the list, but no less
important:<br />
1. fundamental forces of the observable universe- they keep us all
together. literally.<br />
<br />
2. carbon and its four bonds- the kinkiest of all elements, it
wants to get its bondage on with everything, which is good since it
forms the back bone off all life as we know it.<br />
<br />
3. sunlight- aside from that great tan, it drives the lifecycle of
this planet.<br />
<br />
4. h20- it does more than just look good dripping down a buff chest
and chiseled abs.<br />
<br />
5. jockstraps- need i say more?<br />
<br />
6. foxp2 gene- it separates us from animals and neanderthals.
without it we would all be pointing and grunting. and then we would
have no linguistics. then i would be very sad.<br />
<br />
here are the six things i can happily live without:<br />
1. gay on gay bashing- this community is amazing. don't hate it,
embrace it. the guys who put down ""fems"" or ""queens,"" do you have
the balls to live your life so open? lets just hug it out and move
on. we all bring good things to the big gay table, so enjoy
it.<br />
<br />
2. political zealots- i'm all for being caught-up on the haps in
the political world, but it doesn't drive my life. unless they
outlaw puppies, sunshine, ice cream or frolicking naked in the
ocean, let's just be courteous about it and not make a big
deal.<br />
<br />
3. ""real"" housewives- if all those tv shows just vanished, life
would be perfect.<br />
<br />
4. laundry- i hate doing it. i don't want to do. i will hold off as
long as i possibly can.<br />
<br />
5. poor grammar- ""i"" and ""me"" are two very different words. ""u"" is
not a substitute for ""you"" (unless you are on twitter) and don't
forget when to use an apostrophe!<br />
<br />
6. lysosomal storage disorders due to enzyme deficiency caused by
an inborn error of metabolism."

"in no particular order here.....<br />
<br />
- my bicycles....i love cycling although the hills in sf came as a
bit of a surprise to me. they seemed so easy to get-up in the
movies, but i guess steve mcqueen had a few more horsepower in his
car than in my legs. either way, i love getting on the bike and
heading through sausalito and hopefully as far as i can handle.
back home, i used to love midnight rides from london to the
coast.<br />
<br />
- the internet.... i'm a product manager for a valley tech company,
so i'm into all the geekery associated with that. trying to cut
down on the number of excited posts i make on facebook about stupid
tech startups and announcements that bore all of my non-techy
friends.<br />
<br />
- water....rivers, seas, oceans, waterfalls and even drinking the
stuff. h2o is great for the soul and i love being around some sort
of water even if i don't play on/in it as much as i'd like. i'd
definitely like to take the opportunity to learn some sailing or
maybe seeing as winter's coming up, i should figure out what can be
done on snow. hmmm. do i learn to snowboard or ski? i love tough
decisions.<br />
<br />
- my guitar... sadly it gets a bit neglected these days as i prefer
heading out, but despite my tortuous inability to play, i have a
habit of strumming whilst watching tv.<br />
<br />
- planes...12 hours to london, 12 hours to japan. planes are a
bloody miracle and i love them to bits. in fact, watching the blue
angels over the weekend, it was obvious who was having the most fun
in the city. i was very jealous of those buggers!<br />
<br />
- kissing... :) no comment. self explanatory really!<br />
<br />
- italian clothes... after deciding there are alternatives to north
face, i threw out my entire wardrobe and am restocking with stuff
completely inappropriate for sf. think i might be becoming a little
too 'metro'!"

bodies of water and couldn't imagine life without it. i get cold
easily and hate the heat so the climate in the bay area is

dumb, i am not one of those people who can just go all day without
eating, never have been and never will be. plus food is
delicious!<br />

tell you."" i'm not that guy, but the truth is that i've become sort
of attached to my phone for directions, music, podcasts, twitter,
yelp, and more. i'm not proud of it, but there it is.<br />
<br />
2. <strong>my baseball glove</strong> -- i don't use it much these
days (particularly since my shoulder is busted), but in thinking
about which of my possessions i'd least like to lose, it came to
mind. it would make me sad not to own a glove, particularly my
glove from college. feel free to psychoanalyze that, heh.<br />
<br />
3. <strong>body pillows</strong> -- fuck yes body pillows are the
best. they are gigantic and soft and you can spoon with them and
they never judge you except to tell you that you're doing a great
job and look really dashing in those new jeans.<br />
<br />
i have lots of other things i'm attached to or use every day (my
computer, a few autographed things, some old pictures, my
snowboard), but almost nothing that would really crush me if it
disappeared in an apartment fire or something. most stuff can be
replaced. you can't take it with you!"

rely way too heavily on my phone. i'm not the sort of person that's
always on it, i make a point of not doing that, but being able to
look up when muni is coming, movie times, and answers to random
questions at a moment's notice is why i love technology.<br />

2. my apartment -- you don't know this (i hope, creeper) but i have
pretty much the best apartment in the world. and, at this point,
i've been there long enough that it's starting to feel like home. i
absolutely adore having a place i really appreciate to go home to
every night.<br />

3. clipper card -- i am embarrassingly in love with the abstraction
that the clipper card allows me. this bus? no, it doesn't cost
money, it's just my clipper card. that thinking makes me happy and
prevents me from stressing getting about.<br />
<br />
4. a job that i love -- honestly i downplayed this for a very very
long time, just going for the most money i could convince companies
to give me, but now that i have a job that i actually enjoy doing,
this has become a vital part of my happiness. spending most of my
time doing a job i didn't care about would be awful.<br />
<br />
5. coffee -- this seems sad, but i'm convinced that without very
very frequent coffee intake i would either be dead, or more likely,
homeless and poor. it's where i get the motivation to do everything
i do before around 12:30pm. just saying.<br />

certain provisions. the keepers and i have a deal with some of the
local supermarkets so we can feed <em>snaffles</em> enough meat.
but sometimes, maybe every 8 months or so we get ahead of schedule
and find some 'bigger game' ---usually an unfortunate jon doe.
there are so many of them, and it seems a terrible waste when there
are big cats that need to be fed. maybe there are more deserving

meditating on the freeway. also, it takes me to fun places.<br />

love me and send me tasty things to eat on my birthday.<br />

"1. my <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=creative+force"">creative
force</a>: it feels like everything i do in my life from
programming to cooking to conversation stems from this drive to
create something and be able to point to it and say i did that.
the idea that i could start with this blank slate of raw materials
and fashion something that is of genuine value to the world taps
into something deep inside of me.<br />
<br />
2. <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=intellectual+curiosity"">intellectual curiosity</a>:
the idea that 90% of everything there is to know could be boring to
someone is a concept that is totally alien to me. how could you be
a engineer who is not interested in linguistics or a painter who
isn't fascinated by game theory? i acknowledge that there are
people who have their own, narrowly defined sphere of interest and
everything outside of that might as well be <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=urdu+tax+procedures"">urdu tax procedures</a> but i
could never live that life.<br />
<br />
3. <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=humility"">humility</a>:
humility may not be the best word to describe this but it's being
open to the possibility that other people hold equally legitimate
viewpoints as you and that, when they disagree with you, it could
be you who is wrong on some of your most cherished beliefs.
humility seems like one of those things which everybody is sure
they have but i've found it deceptively difficult to accomplish and
it has been a real struggle for me to develop true humility.<br />
<br />
4. <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=acceptance+of+the+unavoidably+essential+nature+of+reality"">
acceptance of the unavoidably essential nature of reality</a>:
there is the world and it is real. and there is our conception of
the world and it is fluid. the world has a certain amount of give,
you can push at reality to a certain extent and it will hold. but
if you start believing too far outside the real, reality will
inevitably push back at you. once you accept that reality is
inevitable and unavoidable, you can figure out how to come to terms
with it.<br />
<br />
5. my <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=privilege"">privilege</a>:
i'm enormously thankful that i grew up in a time and culture that
allowed me to develop my potential. it's only really been within
the lifetimes of our generation that all but the elite had the
opportunity to work on what they were passionate about and be
provided with the tools that allowed them to accomplish it. to see
so much potential being squandered in the world today due to
unfortunate circumstances breaks my heart and i don't see how
people can stand idly by and just let this happen. this is the only
willing concession i will make to my acceptance of reality.<br />
<br />
6. <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=facebook"">facebook</a>: i
know this sounds like a attempt at lightheartedness at the end of
this rather heavy list but i mean it in all seriousness. i rant
about how retarded most modern social software is but the guys at
facebook seem to have their heads screwed on pretty straight and
they've really produced an amazing piece of software from a
sociological perspective. it's not to say it doesn't have its flaws
but it's a fascinating place to explore as a researcher and i
definitely would not have been set on the path that i am now
without it."

coffee<br />
i really like coffee. a lot. i have a coffee-of-the-month-type
subscription, and it is without exaggeration one of the things i've
bought that brings me the most happiness. i have also purchased
kapow! bars
(http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/a-new-kind-of-coffee-bar)
and they were delicious. updated coffee news: recently backed this
kickstarter:
http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/333965871/kone-coffee-filter-brewing-system
and very much looking forward to it.<br />
<br />
cocktails<br />
i'm really interested in making drinks (and getting good at it).
i'm a member of a bourbon-of-the-month club, but i don't drink
really anywhere near an entire bottle a month so i've got a fairly
sizable collection.<br />
i'm currently working on a few drinks, but i've got two potential
winners: one involving bourbon, coffee, and chocolate bitters; and
the other combining rum, cherry, almond syrup, lime juice, and some
bitters. neither are quite perfected yet though.<br />
<br />
books<br />
i used to read like crazy. then i majored in math and computer
science. however i've been getting back into books, and have been
ramping up my reading. in a pattern which is now striking me as
rather similar to the bourbon, i end up buying books at a much
faster rate than i consume them. i recently read freedom (really
liked it), swamplandia! (did not love it), the amazing adventures
of kavalier and clay (liked it), wake up, sir! (very much enjoyed),
the social animal (pretty good), and jonathan strange and mr.
norell (yes i realize i'm far behind the times here but it was
great).<br />
<br />
tv shows<br />
i love tv shows. i've got a very long commute to work, which i used
to spend watching episodes of various shows, though i've mostly
shifted to reading, so i'm behind on a few shows. it is so great to
be introduced to a new show that i haven't seen with a backlog of a
few seasons. some tv shows i love are arrested development (duh),
mad men, archer, 30 rock, parks &amp; recreation, justified,
sherlock, fringe, homeland, the hour, party down, and that's
probably enough to list right now.<br />
<br />
music<br />
i got into music a little late in life, i guess. some of my friends
had shows on the college radio station, so i joined wbor management
and ended up dj-ing for 3 years, doing the website, and concluding
with a 24-hour show (it was awesome). i spend a good portion of my
day at work listening to music, and there are definitely artists
that i feel strongly about. some recent concerts i've been to:
girls, andrew bird, wu lyf, bon iver, john c. reilly, the beach
boys. i also go to the symphony hall probably once every two or
three weeks. if you're interested, you can get an idea of what i
listen to from my last.fm page (http://www.last.fm/user/cybertaur1)
but some of my favorite artists are tom waits, leonard cohen, van
dyke parks, andrew bird, radiohead, brian wilson, arcade fire, owen
pallett, fleet foxes, and well again i could keep going for a while
but i'll stop here.<br />
<br />
dogs<br />
this might be a little odd to put down as a thing i could never do
without given that i'm currently without one, but i love dogs. i've
had one or more for pretty much all of my life (if you're into
pictures of other people's dogs, here's a photo:
http://i.imgur.com/jx8qz.jpg). my apartment has two drawbacks. the
first is that the kitchen is tiny (it's kind of absurd), but the
second and far more important is that there are no dogs allowed.
i'm definitely going to get a dog at some point, hopefully soon."

i'd be dead in a week.""<br />

friend is still in seattle and all of my friends here are straight.
i'm good at walking up to people in bars and introducing myself,
but from past experience it hasn't been a great way to make the
kinds of friends i'm trying to meet.<br />
2. a gym membership, since i rowed crew in high school and college.
i had tendinitis in my left knee in 2003 from overuse -- skiing on
double black diamonds doesn't count as cross-training for a
marathon, apparently -- and couldn't run for 8 months. i switched
to swimming and other lower impact cardio and it requires a
gym.<br />
3. sunscreen, since the last company i co-founded has dermatology
q&amp;a. i admit i didn't use it when i was younger, but it was
cloudy in seattle.<br />
4. internet. i soaked my phone while kayaking in early 2007 and
waited a month to get a new one (bootstrap startup life), so i can
survive without a phone, but not internet. the south park episode
about the broken internet (a la grapes of wrath) is a
favorite.<br />
5. matcha green tea. i stopped drinking coffee last summer, but had
to resume during the cold, dark northwest winter that finally
convinced me to move to sf. matcha green tea is my replacement
since it still has a fair bit of caffeine but also a zen calming
effect.<br />
6. travel. i took long vacations each of the last five years,
although the move to sf will probably count as my big trip for
2012."

particularly helpful. yes, i love my family and friends and i'm
glad you do too. certainly coffee, the internet (and a way to
access it), and intimacy in its various forms are mainstays for
most of us. water, oxygen, food and sleep go without saying. and,
of course, we're all very evolved creatures and recognize that,
when push comes to shove, we're not that tied to material things
and could live without them. well done.<br />

insight into things that matter to you, so i'm going to just start

* my chinchilla<br />
* a camera, pen/paper, or other creative outlet<br />
* q-tips<br />
* a slice of red velvet cake from magnolia bakery on my
birthday<br />
* mellow lighting<br />
* staying up late<br />
* sleeping in late<br />
* the box of random mementos buried at the back of my closet; i've
become a bit sentimental as i've gotten older but am not organized
enough to do anything pretty with those photos, ticket stubs, and
whatnot.<br />
* new balance sneakers. i love fancy girly shoes for dressing up,
but most of the time, i'm all about the kicks.<br />
* my bed. after years of sleeping on cruddy, broken-springed
hand-me-downs, i finally invested in a good one. well worth every
cent, including moving it all the way across the country.<br />
* brussels sprouts roasted with olive oil, pepper and
parmesean<br />
* spellcheck<br />
* the annual call from my mom telling me that the pair of mallard
ducks that always stops by our house each year during their
migration have arrived.<br />
* that tingling feeling up your spine when a series of unresolved
chords finally does<br />
* having unstructured time to just sit and think (or sit and not
think, as the case may be)<br />
* feeling challenged<br />
* having something to look forward to"

eight and a half hours of sleep i'm golden the next day, six to
seven hours of sleep and i can function, but, i'm not happy about
it. five to six hours of sleep and i make careless mistakes and not

the city or walk from one coffee shop to another.<br />

4. passport(s): without them, the world would be a much smaller
place. it's nice to have two (and no, i'm not a smuggler or arms
dealer) as there are certain countries where it pays to be european
while in others, american.<br />

"1.) god/the universe/the one/the all/please, go ahead and insert
your word for it here.<br />
2.) spirituality: loosely defined as 'the lived experience of
faith'. i know many ""paths up the mountain"" that describe spiritual
practices: ""living in faith"", following the way, ""walking the
path"", ""staying in the flow"", etc. the only words i want are the
words that make sense to you. vocabulary can be so misleading
sometimes!<br />
3.) religion. religion is where spirituality is brought into focus
and reinforced through community. i have a rather broad definition
of this due to my love for japanese zen buddhism, and stir in the
deepest, spiritual yoga practices i can find, with the ""final""
blend of our best current ""gurus"" and you know where i am coming
from. of course where i am and where i am going are very different
conversations.<br />
4.) ""family"" by that i mean all of humanity. we are actually all
brothers and sisters transcending all genders, races, classes,
creeds, cultures, languages, and times.<br />
4.) friends . . . uh see ""family"" above.<br />
5.) music &amp; the arts,<br />
6.) ""home"". ""where ever you go . . . that's where you are""! can you
name the movie or the song that i'm quoting?, and finally the
ubiquitous, the wonderful . . . say it with me now . . .<br />
7.) the internet.<br />
<br />
yeah, that's more than 6. if you think that the 6 rule is a rule
that i should have followed, . . . then move on to the next
profile. we're not going match up very well!<br />
<br />
and by the way, if you're surprised that i didn't list my children
here, then all i can say is that i don't call my children ""things""
and we could never go ""without"". my two boys and i could never ever
be separated in the way that matters (love). even the boys live an
hour and a half a way from me now, i fervently believe that
distance can not stop love."

alaska, switzerland, and france are all planned.<br />

"my husband. he knows me and gets me and shows up for me and pushes
me to be my true authentic self or whatever but doesn't do the work
for me, dusts me off when i fall down and cheers for me when i get
up. he gives me space to do me, because he knows exactly who he
married, and he usually makes sure i eat dinner. seriously, that
guy is awesome.<br />
<br />
something to hang upside down from. sometimes i spend a
considerable amount of time and energy pursuing upside-down-things;
other times, i just need to knee-hang from a pull-up bar between
meetings to get through a day. it's not luck that i work at a place
where this is possible, it's a condition of my full-time
employmentand it's not a always convenient requirement, i can tell
you that.<br />
<br />
shampoo. if i couldn't wash my hair, i couldn't have hair, and my
forehead / nose combination does not support a buzz cut. despite a
ferocious affinity for short-short-haired chicks that can pull it
off with a fantastically juxtaposed doe-eyed softness, i concede
that i myself am not among them. this is a limitation i am willing
to work with, but it does make shampoo pretty mandatory.<br />
<br />
a super-juicy medium-point black roller-ball ink pen. my weapon of
choice is a black fine-tipped uniball vision classic, but if you
loan me something that writes a fatter line or writes smoother in
an uncoated-pressboard-covered spiral notebook, i will probably
forget to give it back.<br />
<br />
black lululemon leggings. i know that sounds super pretentious, and
if it is, i will just have to own it because its true. i spend at
least 4 days a week in these things, and they deal with all of my
flailing and bonking into things and upside-down-ing and constant
laundering and still make me feel just a little bit like a
superhero every time i put them on. they're also a staple of my
eccentric post-apocalypse art teacher aesthetic.<br />

without or if they mean i have a normal life but i want to make
sure my life includes these things. i'm going to assume desert
island because it is more fun. since i will need food, i would like
to have a fishing pole. because fishing is boring i would like a
cooler that never runs out of beer so that i could drink beers
while i fished. since drinking makes me want to go have some fun, i
would like there to be a small island bar that has good music and
dancing. since i'm an average dancer, i would like there to be
women who are good dancers so that i look good dancing because
everyone just looks at the women, because let's face it - women are
hot. since there will be women there, i would like to have a very
nice lean-to that i have constructed out of palm fronds and duck
feathers which we could hang out in. what's that? 5? so i get one
more thing? i suppose i'll take a diet coke then."

1. music. (and all my means to listen to it and create it and share
it with others.)<br />

2. smartphone. i never have to look at a map again.<br />

3. bike, to keep me mobile and active. double-whammy!<br />

4. the interwebs. i'm told it's an interlocking system of tubes.
but without it, i wouldn't have a job. seriously, it's humanity's
most incredible - and often depraved - creation.<br />
<br />
5. a zip-up hoodie. it is the perfect blend of jacket and
sweatshirt.<br />
<br />
6. a certain genus of plant, if i'm being completely honest. it
improves music, food, and most sensations. inspirational source,
mood elevator, anti-inflammatory, insomnia cure... i believe in
moderation, and i haven't found that it's gotten in my way."

sunday.<br />
<br />
4. eating delicious food, even more so if i cooked it at home. that
latter part kind of ebbs and flows and depends on my general level
of business/laziness.<br />
<br />
5. intellectual stimulation. sometimes in the form of reading, but
it's usually deep, dark, philosophical conversations about
existence or human nature that leave me satisfied.<br />

"some people take this opportunity to list six categories of things,
and some people list six individual items, and i'm not sure which
is right, so i am going to do both.<br />
<br />
six categories of things i could never do without:<br />
books, women, music....hmm. ok, it turns out that there are only
three categories of things i could never do without. i was going to
say ""the internet"", but i got along without that for like thirty
years, so i know i could if i had to. then i thought about food,
but duh. that's not fair, since it's not a choice. plus, if i could
get along without food, i might. i am trying to think of other
categories of things...oh, wait. friends. i totally need my friends
- i am very social and i love to have smart, funny people around
me. ok, that's four. family? well, i love my family, but i don't
live really near any of them, so i have to say i get along without
them on a day-to-day basis. all right; i guess it's books, music,
women and friends, with two players to be named later.<br />
<br />
six specific items i can't do without:<br />
my messenger bag: i'm not a messenger or anything, but i have this
bag that i carry stuff around in (some people might, if they were
being snide, call it a man-purse, and i could not, in good
conscience, argue with that). this bag is not fancy or anything,
but it is very handy - room for a laptop, a couple of books, some
snacks, ipod and some big-ass earphones, and pretty much whatever
else i want to throw in there. if i didn't have it, i would totally
be fumbling around all the time with my hands full.<br />
<br />
my sense of humor: this might be cheating because it's not an
object, but if i didn't laugh at things i would be a grim waste of
space, and i would have gone nuts by now.<br />
<br />
my shoes: if you saw the street i live on, you would agree. i
really only have one pair of day-to-day shoes, a pair of black
surplus combat boots that i have just been replacing for the last
twenty years when they wear out. i do have other shoes for if i
need to wear a suit on a date, or if i need to fight a duel with
someone, or if i just want to relax with my pipe and a snifter of
brandy in my study*, but really, those black boots are where it's
at for me, foot-wise.<br />
<br />
*i do not have a pipe or a snifter of brandy, or a study, but i do
have a pair of shoes i could wear if i did.<br />
<br />
a gillette mach-3 razor: i hate shaving; i mean, i really hate it,
and if i had either enough money of my own to get my face lasered
up or a sugar-momma who would pay for it, i totally would (and if
you are a potential sugar-momma looking for someone to sponsor, let
me assure you that i would make this so worth your while that you
would probably offer to have the rest of me lasered up just to keep
the sugar flowing), but in the absence of laser depilation, i
cannot express adequately the value of this handy tool. it has
enough blades to take care of my facial hair without having to
scrape for hours but not so many blades that you could legitimately
make fun of me for being a douchebag or a sucker.<br />
<br />
<a class=""plink"" href=""/profile/viewmenu"">viewmenu</a>: she's
great. you don't have to meet her, but you want to, because you'll
like her a lot. she's funny and whimsical and generous and sweet
and cute and brave, and she makes me better than i was before i met
her.<br />
<br />
you: i know, trick ending, right? and you would think, okay, he's
been getting along without me for like forty-plus years, and he
seems to be doing fine, but think about it. i'm still on here
looking, so clearly i feel like i still need to find you. i mean,
it's not like i'm dying or anything without you, but it would be
nice to have you around."

<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=email"">email</a> keeps me in
touch with the world. phones require you to sync up times, which
can be hard when you're in the us and have friends in australia/new

now then use a telephone; if not use email. however i do
acknowledge that it has a small niche, even if it's just to make
sure i'm awake before you phone. apart from thinking im sucks, i
think i suck at it--i often forget to update my status, and i often
leave my stuff logged in, so it looks like i'm online when i'm not.
if i do that to you, all i can say is ""sorry"".<br />
<br />
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=sleep"">sleep</a> is one of
life's great pleasures. heck, just being in bed is nice. i like it
to be really cold when i sleep so i can use heavier bedclothes and
snuggle down in them. i don't sleep well when there are unfamiliar
sounds which makes me wary of sharing rooms with someone i don't
know, and will usually mean i'm kind of cranky the first few times
i sleep with someone new because i didn't sleep well.<br />
<br />
i like <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=coffee"">coffee</a> a
lot, but i don't like messing around with crap. instant coffee is
not coffee. decaffeinated coffee is not coffee. you think
decaffeinated coffee tastes ""just the same""? you're wrong. if
you've read this profile and think it will be okay if you give me
decaffeinated coffee since i won't notice anyway, then my
conclusion is you don't want to be my friend. and you aren't very
smart."

<br />
- creativity is a drug i cannot live without.<br />
<br />
- when you are right you cannot be too radical; when you are wrong,
you cannot be too conservative.<br />
<br />
- any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain - and most fools
do.<br />
<br />
- if you're never scared or embarrassed or hurt, it means you never
take any chances.<br />
<br />
- the happiness of a man in this life does not consist in the
absence but in the mastery of his passions.<br />
<br />
- trust men and they will be true to you; treat them greatly, and
they will show themselves great.<br />

know?<br />

electronic side.<br />

2) what's your favorite place to backpack/camp in northern
california? i have so much left to explore.<br />
<br />
me, i love the wildcat campground in point reyes: a field of
wildflowers on a bluff over looking the ocean, with beach bonfires,
waterfalls, friendly deer...?! why yes, i'll take two.<br />
<br />
3) if you could have a barely useful superpower what would it
be?<br />
<br />
i personally would love to be able to grow a little cup holder out
of any part of my body on demand.<br />
<br />
4) in what ways are you changing/growing this year? what's 2012 the
year of for you?<br />
<br />
this has not been an easy year for me, mainly due to an ongoing
struggle with chronic foot pain (plantar fasciitis). it's been a
real lesson in patience and acceptance. i've also been doing a lot
of reflection and inner work this year and feel ready to truly step
into myself on a new level in my 30s.<br />

it is my personal belief that people find much more common ground
in the things that they dislike than those that they can't do

literally vibrate with all the rage hyperbole can summon:<br />
<br />
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=moving+roadblocks"">moving
roadblocks</a>. that is, people who walk, four-abreast, as slowly
as they can can manage on some narrow or otherwise inconvenient
sidewalk whilst squawking incoherently at one another. what would
you do if people drove like that?<br />
<br />
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=steampunk"">steampunk</a>.
seriously. this shit is over like grover, a simile that doesn't
even make <em>sense</em>, and i feel like cory doctorow is keeping
it alive single-handedly as some personal vendetta against people
who only thought brass gears were cool for fifteen seconds. which
leads me to...<br />
<br />
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=cory+doctorow"">cory
doctorow</a>. i love cory doctorow so much, i hate him. it wrapped
around.<br />
<br />
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=burning+man"">burning man</a>.
in all honesty, i don't have a good reason for this, and i have a
feeling that i'll catch some flack for it. it probably has
something in common with why i hate steampunk.<br />
<br />
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=myopia"">myopia</a>. to be
clear, i don't have anything against *your* myopia, only my own.
it's the kind that's just bad enough that most doctors won't offer
me laser surgery without some kind of waiver. i guess i'd rather be
nearsighted than blind.<br />
<br />
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=computers"">computers</a>. you
might think that this is out-of-place, given the fact that i
program computers for a living, but i really can't get past the
fact that they're basically rube goldberg machines without any of
the funny. this is a fact that i've resigned myself to, however, as
it's apparent that they're not really going anywhere and provide me
with a job that doesn't involve mining coal, which is where i'd be
if this grotesque steampunk fantasy were true. probably you too.
coal. think about that.<br />

"passionate musicians. the music i listen to needs to have a soul
behind it. if every song were constructed for mass commercial
viability, i would pull a hemingway exit. i don't care if you have
talent or not; if you play/sing your heart out, i'll love it
regardless. (cap'n jazz, i'm looking at you.)<br />
<br />
clean water. the amount of people who don't drink water on a daily
basis is confounding. it's the simplest and single most healthy
thing you can do for yourself. if i can't get to a source of clean
water, i feel inhuman. my apartment lacks drinkable water, so i
usually end up spending a lot of time at friends' houses.<br />
<br />
hope. this is not an obama reference. i don't mean it in a
revolutionary, partisan way. without hope, i would not have made it
through the worst losses and tribulations of my life. i would not
be here today, typing these words. it's a word i tend to use often,
and i mean it every time.<br />
<br />
love. i've known people who have lived their entire lives without
knowing love, not from family, friends, or relationships. i could
never imagine being able to survive a life like that. from the
cradle onward, i've known love and had love in my heart, even for
the people i can't stand. they are the ones who usually need it
most.<br />
<br />
games. an essential part of life, games keep me sane. whether it's
by playing a game of baseball, scribbling through a crossword
puzzle, hugging the corner to shave off that one-tenth second at
the track (i.e. hwy 1), pounding the skins on rock band, losing at
chess, trying to toss popcorn into my mouth while just barely
getting it to graze the ceiling (because if it bounces off, you
lose) or poorly bluffing my way through a rare 3am card/drinking
game, i need recreation to feel alive. all work and no play are two
concepts completely lacking from my life.<br />
<br />
gourmet cooking. a well-prepared meal solidifies my faith in
humanity and intelligence. it isn't easy to perfectly sear a fresh
ribeye or roll out a crispy cilicia. living in the land of the
sweet tooth, subtlety in cuisine is underrated. when done right, a
gourmet meal will invigorate all five senses and can be
intoxicating. you know a meal is made right when the people eating
it sound like they could be having sex. you know what i'm talking
about."

tend to dislike them.<br />

soul.<br />
<b>(2)</b> intimacy! people to have deep conversations with and hug
and touch.<br />
<b>(3)</b> variety! (or else i get all bored and stuff.)<br />
<b>(4)</b> introspection. i find that i sometimes need several
hours to a couple days of utter isolation to recover/get over
slumps; down-time from being all crazy and gregarious.<br />
<b>(5)</b> beauty! (though life and existence are ugly and rough,
they are also beautiful and resplendent, you know? i'm stunned so
often by the world and i hope i never lose that sense of awe and
wonder. then i'd almost rather be dead.)<br />
<br />
<b>(6)</b> hope! though really it's a ridiculous concept, there's
no reason why things should go better than they have been,
cosmically speaking...but you've gotta be able to get up in the
morning. perhaps a better term is ""confidence in the future,"" which
civilization can provide.<br />
<br />
<b>(7)</b>a kitchen! i cook erry'dayyy, and not having fresh
veggies to chop up and put in bowls then cook, and other delish
selections, makes me a sad man. it's a form of meditation.<br />
<br />
<b>(8)</b>my chrome bag. i never really noticed that i have it with
me. always. it's my toolkit. i even go running with it
sometimes.<br />

i've got and they always have my best interest in mind.<br />

my car- it has cool features!<br />

in their car. i'm one of those talentless people who love to sing
and actually need to sing sometimes. don't worry, i do all that in
private. i won't burden your ears! :) i also used to love to
dance...in essence, music is fairly important to me.<br />

so much out there! whoah...just got a tad too excited. i love

they were an awesome tv show, and waaay before they were
cool.<br />

music - i know this is pretty cliche, but i love my music. not just
in the car on my way to work, i like it when i'm falling asleep,
when i'm showering, when i'm cooking, especially when i'm
cleaning...you get the idea. i'm from a very musical family, so i
have strong opinions and can be picky. i love finding new bands
nobody knows about, and take it very personally when their tickets
start costing a small fortune when the hipster population decides
they are worth listening to...<br />
<br />
speaking of hipsters...i love my san francisco. sometimes we have a
slightly volatile relationship, but i cant imagine living anywhere
else. ny maybe, but i'd be back eventually.<br />
<br />
i also cant live without a planned trip or vacation. life gets
hectic and stressful and i need something to look forward to. i've
made a conscious effort to go somewhere every year. so far, i've
covered a big chunk of europe...and pieces of the us. asia
next...<br />
<br />
of course family and friends...which does not need a thorough
explanation. my family is very close, and my friends are amazing
people.<br />
<br />
aaaannnd animals. i've grown up with pets of all kinds; i've had
chinchillas, parrots, dogs, turtles, and everything in between. i
desperately want a dog, but i'm rarely home and don't want to
torture the poor animal in my apartment without a yard, so i got
the cutest ginger kitten instead. it was a happy accident, never
thought i'd like having a cat, but hes awesome!"

"i'm going to assume indoor plumbing and penicillin are a given
here, so here's just six things i really like to have around:<br />
<br />
books - and a lot of them. of all varieties. ebooks are okay, but
it makes for a pretty empty bookshelf.<br />
<br />
the ocean. i've never lived further than an hour away from it for
longer than a summer, and even though i don't visit it as often as
i should, there's something comforting about knowing there's a very
large body of water i can go look at whenever i want.<br />
<br />
music. this feels like a cliche thing to mention, but in my defense
there is something universally appealing about music. it's like
math, only it can stimulate emotions other than frustration.<br />
<br />
my iphone. i mention this less in an 'i'm obsessed with sms and
checking my facebook every hour' way, and more in an 'i would get
lost even more than i already do and would never know how to find
good places to eat' way. without google maps, i would be terrified
to drive anywhere.<br />
<br />
my desk. i'm not one of those people that can lay in bed with a
computer and be terribly productive. there's something about
sitting at a desk that says, ""time for working now."" i get things
done, with a desk.<br />
<br />
tea. some people in the city are coffee connoisseurs, and i can be
the same way about tea. many problems can be solved by sitting and
drinking a good cup of tea."

"i was reminded last month on my fortieth birthday that the only
thing i couldn't live without is the connection and love i share
with my family and friends. one of my birthday gifts this year was
a book filled with letters, roasts, and toasts from the closest
people in my life. here are a few samples of what they wrote that
will give you some insight into my personality:<br />
<br />
she'll tell you her mind and sometimes you find<br />
a sailor with words, using truck driver verbs<br />
a strong willed woman, stubborn like me<br />
she knows what she likes, you ask her you'll see<br />
you'll find a good listener too<br />
but always you'll find a lover of fools<br />
<br />
you make fun of yourself more than you make fun of other people.
your humor always borders on offensive (actually, a lot of the time
it makes a run for the border and keeps going), but what makes it
so golden is that there's never a malicious ingredient. when you
make fun of people, there's a feeling of we're all in this
together rather than look at that moron. you're adventurous.
you're always up for trying new things and you're a daredevil,
whether its snowboarding, gambling, or just saying something brave
that no one else wants to say. but you're not just funny. you are
also steadfast and reliable. you're a good friend, and when the
shit hits the fan, you are the best at lending an honest, loving,
steady hand. you have more depth than people sometimes initially
see. you like to talk about philosophy and ideas, and that makes
you interesting. you're genuine. you don't put on pretenses and you
think things through and make up your own mind about them, no
matter how unpopular you're position may be. you have a positive
outlook, but it's real. you're not ned flanders pretending like
everything is groovy when it's not.<br />
<br />
my favorite thing about you is that you are not afraid to share
every beautiful, gross, funny, ugly, embarrassing, and inspiring
thing about yourself with those close to you (and sometimes
strangers too). when you do this, you put out this message of i
know you won't judge me. in turn, i feel like i can trust you and
feel safe with you as i know you won't judge me. so i believe that
sharing personal things with you is the greatest compliment i can
give you.<br />
<br />
my biggest compliment to you is that whenever i am organizing or
hosting an event for a few people, inevitably, my other friends, my
stepdaughters, my husband and my husband's friends always ask, is
'she' going to be there? (i'd like to say it's a nervous inquiry,
but it is always a hopeful one!)"

other things from going wrong (i mean this in both a 'big' and
'less big' sense ... but mostly 'big').<br />

items.<br />
<br />
in fact, lists without precisely five items would rank as #1 or #2
in the top 5 mistakes to avoid when writing lists.<br />
<br />
but i digress. my list:<br />
<br />
* flexible work hours.<br />
* restaurants, netflix, zipcar, and all the other marvelous
services out there offering stuff on demand. owning things just
sucks.<br />
* indian food, despite surviving 23 years without any. talk about
the allegory of the cave.<br />
* accidents, waiting to happen.<br />
* good conversation. ideas. crazy ideas. polemics: ""if everything
you believe is something you're supposed to believe, could that
possibly be a coincidence? odds are you just think whatever you're
told""."
