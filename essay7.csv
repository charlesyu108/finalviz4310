"by ""friday night"" they mean any night i might go out. the regular
activities in sf that keep me occupied:<br />
<br />
~ i go to sushi or ""organic bistro style food"" about six times a
week.<br />
<br />
~ i go to pretty much every show that rocker t plays in the bay
area, and i'm never by myself for it. he is a good friend to me,
and we have an understanding about how the condition i live with
requires a lot of ganja smoke, so there's always space in the green
room for me and one or two of the people i'm with when we go see
him do music.<br />
<br />
~ the second thing are the onetaste school's sexuality and female
orgasm focused discussions. they tried calling it ""orgasm"" without
female in front of it when they first started, but only men showed
up, so they changed the description. i feel like the low blood
count i had to live with for so long has kept me from understanding
a lot about the sensation and spiritual dynamic most people expect
from sex, so getting to hear ""normal"" people talk about it makes me
feel that much less left out. i'm not a sexless person by any
means, but the body i have is so different from what i think of as
a ""big strong man"" that the sex i do have is nothing like what it
must be like for vibrant aggressive people.<br />
<br />
~ i will occasionally attend a mdmj benefit in order to network
with people that might need to meet someone who crafts medicine in
the unique way i practice.<br />
<br />
~ comedy shows once in a while. mainly just to see rick overton
when he comes to the bay area.<br />
<br />
~ seeing friends in the east or north bay.<br />
<br />
this horizon could be a bit more broad, but that's what i'm betting
on okc for helping out with right now.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
and twice a month i do about 48 hours of jumping from rooftop to
rooftop chasing villains and fighting crime before i come back to
the castle where <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dennis_peron"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dennis</a>chastises me while stitching fresh wounds and
pouring chicken soup..<br />
wait.. no, that's batman and alfred.<br />
what i do for 48 hours twice a month is craft mdmj derivatives.
then i come back to the castle and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dennis_peron"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dennis</a> tells me to not work so hard anymore.<br />
shoulda thought of that one before you set up the foundation for a
super giant mdmj infrastructure for the next generation to support

like right now, i'm working at 4am on a saturday and that's ok.
knowing the day of the week, or the month or anything of that
nature is equivalent to telling the time of day by pointing to
where the sun is in the sky. fridays are no better and no worse
than mondays to anyone but garfield. our understanding of time vis
a vis its real nature is a central question of epistemology and one
that remains open to interpretation. jme mctaggart argued that
time, as it is conventionally appreciated, is a social construct
with no real relation to a specific phenomenon of time. do you want
to get your philosophy of time from a cartoon cat? of course you
do. be my guest, jackass."

imagine a land of supple green hills and infinite puppies. where
you sit by a shimmering blue lake as trees slowly fade in and out
of existence. there is a slightly sweet smell in the air of
honeysuckle and the sun is warm upon your head. xkala, a
scientologist, level 17, greets you with cool hands and a glass of
water.<br />
<br />
you take the water into your hands, which are cooled immediately,
almost to the point of pain. peering down into the water you see
small bubbles slowly rising and clinging to the sides. as you
continue to stare the water seems to move ever close and the
bubbles rise around you and suddenly you find yourself in the lake
floating on a large turtle.<br />
<br />
""get off my back!"" yells the turtle and you promptly roll into the
warm water. you are heavy in this water. too heavy to float and too
heavy to tread, though you try. you begin to sink, strangely
without any fear and as your lungs fill with the warm liquid you
feel your arms turning into flippers and your feet a tail!<br />
<br />
now you swim! swim with speed. you dart from spot to spot, taking
in the wonders of this new brilliant amazing world! the colours are
staggering and you move with such swiftness that you find it hard
to maintain focus on any one thing for too long.<br />
<br />
ahead of you lies a tunnel and in the distance you hear a slight
rumble. approaching the tunnel you find yourself knowing that this
is your destiny, this is what you were meant to do. with every
fiber of your being you push and toil towards the tunnel to find
this answer to your destiny. the water around you pulses now with
an energy as though it can feel your desire. the pulses push you
faster, faster, faster until everything becomes a blur. you are
near your one true desti!!!!<br />

"no typical night: here are some recipes for fantasy nights, make
'em yours if you'd like, with or without me:<br />
<br />
1) walk along beach at dusk up to cliff house and back to beach
chalet. dinner and wine over sunset. finish with a bonfire by
beach.<br />
<br />
2) we dress up in silks like it's prom night &amp; glide
mischievously into an out-of-town drive-in theater, in a
convertible. pop open root beer mini-refrigerator &amp; chill. when
everyone is seriously watching the movie we release the helium
balloons &amp; watch as they waft across screen trying very hard
not to giggle too much. and then get back to business with all the
heavy kissing &amp; more.<br />
<br />
3) we pack up and leave the city before 2pm and head to the
wilderness. set up camp, hammocks and bear-proof the food. at
night, we connect the dots &amp; dream while gazing at the stars,
sipping chai or whatever's in the flask.<br />
<br />
4) go dancing in town and when hungry end up in chinatown. practice
cantonese until they throw us out at 2 am because we butchered the
language enough even before the accent.<br />
<br />
5) have a private potluck for 2 at home. light up the tiki torches
in the backyard &amp; the bbq grill. pack the hookah with a smooth
herbal blend. turn off all the lights and read some rumi in the
fire. over some malbec. when the fires are out, come back indoors
in the light of the lava lamp. take out the warm dessert from the
oven and spread some creme fraiche and honey over it. eat with
fingers while curling up on the kama chaise lounge. serves 2.<br />
<br />
6) any suggestions you want to add?"

did more. i need a posse or whatever it takes to make that
possible. people have told me grown-ups in sf ""don't go out"" to
clubs - just dinner and dinner parties, leaving young 20-whatevers,
tourists, and serious drinkers. i hope that's not true. i like
readings, art installations even if they don't make much sense,
gallery openings, street food, the occasional parade as long as i
can leave after an hour or two. several years in a marching band
sort of cured me of parades, though the chinese new year and other

nights from last year that i haven't updated for ages, i did the

<br />
16 october: first night of the weekend-long mission open studios
extravaganza - we went to a place we'd never been just across
market st. (i'm skeptical that it's actually in the mission - i
would have said it was in the duboce triangle neighborhood, or
maybe castro or even alamo square, but whatever - yay art!) then we
ate at a hideous restaurant on sanchez called tangerine. it was
bad. i did a snarky yelp review. and then we slept in anticipation
of more awesome art the next day.<br />
<br />
24 october: spontaneous last-minute trip up the coast for a night
in point reyes, followed by hiking on the alamere falls trail on
saturday. on our way up north, we stopped at the pelican inn and
pub in muir beach, which was more like a real english pub than
anything i've seen outside of the uk so far in my travels.<br />
<br />
31 october: halloween! a rare late night out for me and the
colinbot; i managed to hit four separate parties that day (though i
admit for me one of them was the adorable preschool party at school
that day). we did last-minute low achievement costumes and played
some rock band and went to a haunted house and generally tore it
up. good times.<br />
<br />
7 november: still riding the high from the election on friday. oh
lordy. after a long week of work and celebration, we needed a
quieter kind of night. so we invited ourselves over to dinner at
christy and eric's for chicken and cauliflower curry and general

acting silly, (which i believe is an important part of staying
sane) i may check out an air guitar competition, go bowling in 70's
clothes, or cause havoc in a santa suit (santacon). about once a
week i can be found dancing at some electronic music event, but i'm
not really into the club scene (or any scene for that matter  why
limit yourself?) i prefer more underground events  where people
are truly there for the music and to dance, not to be seen at

oh yeah, i might be running. i like running in the dark and in the
cool night air. there are some hazards. for example, i ran into a
deer the other evening. because it has come up, i should say i am

the <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=endorphins"">endorphins</a>.

care much more about your brain and heart than whether you run, do
yoga, or whatever. of course active is nice.)<br />
<br />
in all honesty, dinner parties and night running were things i did
when i lived in smaller cities/the woods. now that i live in sf, i
can't say exactly what is typical. maybe live music or social art,
a drink, dinner out/in with old friends, or just an early bedtime
so i can spring into action on saturday morning.<br />
<br />
despite moving from the woods to the city, i still bump into
animals when running... or at least on my cool down walk. the other
day a very short man with no teeth who seemed to have an affinity
for crack cocaine ran up to me and repeatedly jabbed me in the ribs
yelling, ""hot! you must be hot! hot! you must be hot!"". english was
not his first language and i think he meant cold because it was
about 40 degrees and i was wearing running shorts and no shirt.

it's been so long since we've hung out! did you recover from that
nasty hangover? i told you not to mix redbull and miller light. is
it possible to do something low key next time? i mean, i love going
out and all, but sometimes it's hard to be social when it's so
dark, and i can't distinguish the difference between keisha and
katy perry when i'm distracted by sweaty dancers in their birthday
suits. plus, they don't have hot ginger tea at the cafe.<br />

"i moved up to san francisco last year and everything has gone
weird.<br />
<br />
i've been hanging out with a lot of people i don't know. with my
friends, it's the usual talking, drinking, dancing, movie-going and
more talking, talking, talking. i don't know what more to say about
this without sounding hopelessly dull. i like people. there. that's
fine.<br />
<br />
lately, i've been picking a night out of the week to be my ""study
night"" and that's landed on friday more than once. it's hilariously
nerdy, okay? i realize that.<br />
<br />
i didn't study much in school, but something changed a few years
back. i love the kinds of things i'm getting paid to do now, and i
keep practicing and practicing and reading and reading. i'm hoping
to get good enough that i can turn it into never having to do
anything but what i want to do.<br />

how many people aren't, really? it's a stupid treadmill to be on.
but i love how it makes me feel."

enjoy a fun bar where i can dance.<br />

in love with the music. i'll stand around in a bart station in the
middle of the night listening to a guy with a fiddle.<br />

food: i'm always looking for great food to eat. i don't cook too
often these days, but am happy to put a meal together for friends.

"there were once five peas in one shell, they were green, the shell
was green, and so they believed that the whole world must be green
also, which was a very natural conclusion. the shell grew, and the
peas grew, they accommodated themselves to their position, and sat
all in a row. the sun shone without and warmed the shell, and the
rain made it clear and transparent; it was mild and agreeable in
broad daylight, and dark at night, as it generally is; and the peas
as they sat there grew bigger and bigger, and more thoughtful as
they mused, for they felt there must be something else for them to
do.<br />
<br />
are we to sit here forever? asked one; shall we not become hard
by sitting so long? it seems to me there must be something outside,
and i feel sure of it.<br />
<br />
and as weeks passed by, the peas became yellow, and the shell
became yellow.<br />
<br />
all the world is turning yellow, i suppose, said they,and
perhaps they were right.<br />
<br />
suddenly they felt a pull at the shell; it was torn off, and held
in human hands, then slipped into the pocket of a jacket in company
with other full pods.<br />
<br />
now we shall soon be opened, said one,just what they all
wanted.<br />
<br />
i should like to know which of us will travel furthest, said the
smallest of the five; we shall soon see now.<br />
<br />
what is to happen will happen, said the largest pea.<br />
<br />
crack went the shell as it burst, and the five peas rolled out
into the bright sunshine. there they lay in a child's hand. a
little boy was holding them tightly, and said they were fine peas
for his pea-shooter. and immediately he put one in and shot it
out.<br />
<br />
now i am flying out into the wide world, said he; catch me if
you can; and he was gone in a moment.<br />
<br />
i, said the second, intend to fly straight to the sun, that is a
shell that lets itself be seen, and it will suit me exactly; and
away he went.<br />
<br />
we will go to sleep wherever we find ourselves, said the two
next, we shall still be rolling onwards; and they did certainly
fall on the floor, and roll about before they got into the
pea-shooter; but they were put in for all that. we shall go
farther than the others, said they.<br />

<a class=""ilink"" href=

pea-shooter; and as he spoke he flew up against an old board under

filled up with moss and soft earth. the moss closed itself round
him, and there he lay, a captive indeed, but not unnoticed by
time.<br />

used to bartend friday nights, but as of recently, i have cut back
on my shifts. after having worked on fridays for so many years, i
find that i have no damn idea what to do when i have a friday night
free. i know what i don't want to do though, so let's start there.
i don't want to go to ""the club""- that's for sure. i don't want to
squeeze into an ill fitting dress, and drag myself onto a packed
dance floor where a bunch of drugged up idiots listen to some dj
play what sounds like the same damn song for 4 hours...i might be a
little jaded from having bartended at a club for a few
years...<br />
anyway, i don't really give a shit what night of the week it is. i
guess i just want to have fun regardless. what constitutes fun can
vary greatly for me depending on my mood. i like a bit of
randomness and adventure, and am down to try most things. here's a
list of things that i have considered fun in the past: bowling,
dive bar, show, movie, broadway play, circus, air-hockey, game
night with friends, hiking, rock climbing, yoga, dinner, drinks,
sitting on the couch, cooking, video games, backgammon...i don't
know anything can be fun with the right person.<br />
i also enjoy randomness and fun that is a little out of the norm.
last week i won free dessert for me and my roomie by accepting a
push-up challenge. the bartender at our restaurant called bullshit
on me when he overheard me claiming i could do 35 push-ups
(""man-style""). he asked me to prove myself, so i did- the last 10
were a little shaky, but i prevailed and won us some sort of
chocolate yummy treat. victory was delicious."
"often out with friends to support the bands i know, or seeing a
show downtown. and hey, i even stay in now and then :)"
realistically...bumming at home with a beer.
"usually having dinner in the city with friends, and drinking
wine.... but you never know."
"mostly, i'm either having dinner with friends or a pizza &amp; a
movie with my kid - both are a great way to end the week.

"most likely at a bar with friends, or kickin it at home smokin with
my roomies. fridays are my day off, i like to get shit done!"
"either on my couch watching tv with a bottle of wine or out to
dinner and/or drinks with friends. it depends on my mood."
"in bed early... i've been riding the mellow train these days but
hopefully soon i can write something really cool and thrilling in
this box."
getting excited for early saturday morning football games.
meandering with friends.
recovering from sunday-thursday
"i'm sure like most people, working or at a bar trying to forget
about work. or just at home or at my artist studio."
out for drinks or dinner with friends!
""
being social.
"doing the obvious two things everyone is doing: at home or out
doing something fun! (or school related work)"
"bringin' home bacon, or drinking and shakin'!"
what i would do on any other day. everydays a friday ..
"out at happy hour with my friends, running into other friends,
ranting about something hardly worth the rant .. or at home."
