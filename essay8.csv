newfound knowledge in everyday conversations.<br />

not long ago i was watching msnbc, where a doctor was informing
those enthused anchors of the health benefits associated with
eating your own boogers (whatever you do... do not stop reading
here). he continued to explain that the nose functions like an air
filter, and that all sorts of bacteria are often caught by our
mucus excretion. he further explained that by eating these we are
in essence giving ourselves booster shots  resulting in a more
responsive immune system. coming from a degreed professional all of
this seamed plausible (argumentum ad verecundiam- there is even a
term for it).<br />
<br />
later that week i made sure to pass this information along to
friends, classmates and even colleagues. every time i started out
by prefacing my statements-of-fact by letting them know that a well
known health professional encourages <br />
<br />
the more i spread the story, the more i believed it myself, then
one of my friends asked when i saw this story, i recalled that it
was either in late march or early april... as in april fools
day.<br />
<br />
i recall it was a very humbling moment for me, i thought to myself
april fools omg those fuckers!! the got me.<br />

trolling the streets eating their own boogers! what have i
done?!?<br />

got my eyeballs.<br />
2. despite being a pacifist, i watched all 8 seasons of 24. that's
right, jack bauer stole 8 days* of my life.<br />
3. i lost a small piece of myself in the eponymous tv series known
as lost. aka the train wreck i just had to watch.<br />
<br />
* thankfully, i only binge on commercial-free, 'fast-forward
unnecessary side-plots' versions so that instead of losing 8 entire
days of my life, i saved 3 days of my life. i saved 3 whole days of
my life! doesn't that sound better? except, then i proceeded to
unwisely spend those 3 days on item #3. thankfully, i was able to
save another 3 days on item #3 which i then proceeded to waste on
item #4...<br />

and so it goes.<br />

3 potential deal breakers: for everything i do have, i don't have
the following**.<br />
<br />
1. car: as i mentioned before, except in 10% of the cases where i'm
too lazy to bike to work, this is not a problem in the bay
area.<br />
2. tv: it's dying. get with it.<br />
3. fb: should i get with it? probably. but i'm doing just fine with
my old-school network. you know, calling people on rotary phones
(well, not really), writing hand-written letters (really), and you
know, actually meeting and conversing in person (seriously).<br />

and we went in. we had palm readings and aura readings and tarot
readings and some other reading involving hopefully non-toxic
crystals before we got to the past lives booth. i went first. the
psychic said she was getting a very clear picture of the ancient
me: swirling sand ... pyramids ... a baby floating on a river.

line were very impressed.<br />

infrared-triggered digital night vision cameras to track feeding
patterns while in the comfort of your own home. artificial sex
hormones to attract prey. high velocity hollow points for single
shot take downs. it's bambi, for crissake. and that bear would
probably only attack you if you were stupid enough to mess with her
cub. you want sport? try this: sharpen a good sized stick. strip
down naked, go into the forest, and take on something with claws,
tusks, or fangs. when the odds are 50/50, that's sport. and if you
win, don't just take the head and a few choice cuts. there's a
reason the native americans hate us."

one day, quietly, with no warning, she said, ""will you hold
me?""<br />
and so he did, of course. his arms around her in an embrace that
fitted his body to hers. kissing her hair, eyelids, tip of nose.
asking, ""did something go wrong? did you have a scare?""<br />
she seems not to have heard, her arms around him tight,
tight.<br />
feeling against her cheek the comforting scratchiness of the wool
sweater she'd knitted him years ago. when they were newly
lovers.<br />
minutes passed. how very odd. he felt her trembling -- a deep
subterranean shuttering. he asked,<br />
""you didn't have an accident with your car, did you?"" and,<br />
""did someone threaten you?"" and, ""what is it?""<br />
still she made no reply. gripping him close.<br />
so he was having difficulty breathing. so his heartbeat quickened,
as if in the presence of danger.<br />
he said, ""darling, please, i love you - what is it?""<br />
he tried gently to push her away from him, just a bit, so that he
could see her face. for, suddenly, it seemed to him he could not
recall her face.<br />
but she was holding him tight, tight.<br />
saying, almost inaudibly, so that he felt rather than heard her
words, ""just hold me.""<br />
""yes, but -- what is it?""<br />
how many minutes of this embrace could he endure? five? ten? sixty?
one thousand? he said, bravely, ""yes. i'm here.""<br />
outside, an unexpected rain pelted against the windows -- or was
that sunshine? that sudden glare?<br />

i am seriously looking or really just want to enjoy the

desperate to find the ""one"".<br />

i don't want to be your trophy wife or arm decoration either. i've
worked for years to stand on my own two feet, and i delight in
disconcerting people by stepping down off of pedestals.<br />
<br />
...and i haven't got the time or desire to ""fix"" you. people who
manage other people spend many hours a week fixing people, and
getting paid for it. it's fine, i enjoy it at some level - and i
seem to be good at it - ...and i want to relax when i get home, not
manage my partner, too. that doesn't mean i'm not supportive, it
means i expect you to be an adult and not think that's a dirty
word. you have to be a capable individual who makes an excellent
team member, not a half of something looking to be made whole. if i
have to be more professional at home than i do at the office, well,

super flattering to any women's physique and, of course a timeless

naomi watts is credited with having brought bonnets and overalls
back onto the 21th century american stage, without slipping back
into a 19th century- country boys trying to outbid each other over
a gal's box-lunch at the county fair-high plains justice, let's
pick on the outsider, kind of theme. naomi really reminded us all
of what a woman, reduced to her core and vulnerable self, can bring
to a pair of oversized denim overalls and a shapelss hair
concealing bonnet--need i say steamy intensity, sex-appeal, courage
and a lack of panty lines. i like to think that i have also been a
pioneer in that pursuit. prologue: i do wear a lot of dresses (yet,

actually, i have something more private to share. i like to call my
roommate ""fat"" in one variation or another. it all started when she
kicked an air mattress when i was trying to sleep on it and has
continued for over a month. update: 4 months in and i still call
her fat, and often. in addition, ""so's your face"" is a major part
of my vocabulary. update 2: not calling her fat as often. it's
still funny, i've just forgotten to as much. update 3: she's not my
roommate any more. though not due to the fat comments. new roommate
is a tall guy, who calling fat doesn't have an effect on. update 4:
new roommates all together. one of them is a good friend and we eat
things that are terrible for us and refer to ourselves as the fat
kid club...though i am skinnier than i've been in years :-p latest
idea for fat kid club is cinnamon rolls with candied (beef) bacon
in them and a maple glaze with a little fleur de sel on top."

"goodbye.<br />
hello?<br />
<br />
my head rolled above the surface of the water for a moment; my
consciousness gasping for breath.<br />
i tried to focus my eyes on the edge of the bed, on the floor, on
the ceiling. my world remained a blur. lifting my head forced the
room into a barrel roll. something red started flying in circles
around my head; or was i staring at? there was shuffling.<br />
minutes later, hours later, days later, seconds later, i was awake
again. bolt upright in my bed. i saw boxes strewn around the room.
i had no fucking clue where i was; i rolled back over.<br />
<br />
if ever you wake up alone in a strange environment my advice is to
sleep in. because fuck it, the amount of time you lay alone in a
stranger's bed doesn't affect how strange they may be. and it
doesn't matter what the situation ends up being when wake up, it's
always best to be well rested.<br />
<br />
i peeled my eyes open to try and get my bearings, there was a pile
of boxes along the wall. one had fragile scrawled in block
letters, the handwriting was mine. fuck. this is always a terrible
realization to have.<br />
<br />
i was laying in my own bed, in my new bedroom. moving four times in
a month and a half was leaving me a stranger in a familiar
land.<br />
<br />
something was amiss though, i had everything in my life inside
brown boxes, that splash of color was all i could think about. that
splash of crimson that spun around my head before i could fully
emerge from the cool waters of sleep. it had moved too, i was sure
of it. not just in it's spinning someone had picked it up.someone.
my head sank back into the pillows and i smiled to myself. for a
split second the 14 year old version of myself resurfaced.
nofuckingwaydude! awesome!!<br />
<br />
::<br />
<br />
suddenly i was back in the bar, desperately drunk. we'd known of
each other from years before, back when we were freshmen in
college, just well enough that we could dance together, just poorly
enough that we finished our first drink before the song was
over.<br />
<br />
we went to the bar for another round. vodka tonic, clean enough to
keep me straight until i needed to be crooked, and just strong
enough to make me want to become that crook. more dancing. things
start to get fuzzy here.<br />
<br />
we're looking for her car. stumbling through the cold night. i
shove her against the wall and finally kiss her. we knew the score
the second we walked out of that dim bar, but even drunk and sure
of yourself, fear grips you for that split second as you dive face
first into the night. her car's nowhere to be found; thank god. the
search sent us to a parking lot, and the parking lot led to
privacy, and privacy, well; privacy led my hand up her skirt.<br />
<br />
::<br />
<br />
i try and roll out of bed. jesus christ i need water. my eyes land
on the spot on floor where the red once laid. my stomach lurches,
last night keeps wanting to come up in waves. the parking lot, the
parking lot, i smile and immediately groan. i waved at a group of
smokers while i fucked her in the parking lot.<br />
<br />
we left the parking lot quickly. all winking smiles and hands. had
to get home - had to get somewhere to lay down. my blood bubbled
the vodka up into my brain - i remember leaving the parking lot
then throwing her down on my bed. then the act. le petite
mort.<br />
<br />
::<br />
<br />
it's never the act worth reveling in, it's the build up, the
anticipation. the trying and failing, the push and pull. waking up
the next morning and having the memories slowly wash over you. not
believing it's real until you recall that moment when it was all
said and done, when you hung your head backwards off the bed and
saw the most beautiful thing in a world. a deep crimson red bra,
tossed asunder."

"here is one story..<br />
<br />
having finally decided that it was in my best interest to get back
to the states, i said farewell to my friends and acquaintances in
northern france. it had been a long 11 months of adventure and due
to my procrastination to return, i had a mere 3 days until my fixed
ticket return flight from amsterdam to san francisco.<br />
<br />
as usual, i had no money. cedric, my traveling companion for much
of that 11 months was sorry to see me go. he left me playing music
on the streets in caen. i made the usual 30 francs and hopped on
the train.... without a ticket.<br />
<br />
the train from caen to paris was a pleasant evening ride. no pesky
controller looking for tickets. paris of course was a different
story. a few days prior, a bomb had gone off in the subway and the
station was combing with military police. i chickened out on 3 of
the 4 evening bullet trains headed to amsterdam. tickets were being
checked prior to boarding which was not the usual drill. i sat
around nervously for hours until i had no choice. the last train
was boarding.<br />
<br />
i watched all the normal passengers line up, until finally the
telecom announced final boarding call. people now in a hurry. the
controllers started blowing their whistles. military police, dogs
and guns walking in their calculated patterns.<br />
<br />
it was my chance. i ran towards the train, the engines were
starting up. i was waving towards my imaginary parents when i was
stopped and asked for my ticket. ""ticket?"" i said surprised. ""oh
right, shit! it's somewhere in my bag."" i began to look through my
backpack. ""just get on!"" he said, obviously annoyed, ""we'll check
it inside, the train is leaving"".<br />
<br />
inside, i was overwhelmed with relief. i kept going until i felt i
was about in the center of the train. by the time i found a cabin,
the train had been on the move for a good 10 minutes. i choose to
sit next to a disheveled looking moroccan for strategic reasons,
knowing that the prejudice of the french would take attention away
from me. it's hard to actually evade the controllers on the bullet
trains since there are few stops where you can get on and off. this
evening was a simple matter of getting as far north as
possible.<br />
<br />
i took a nap.<br />
<br />
i was woken up to the sight and sound of 2 meaty looking
controllers making fun of the moroccan guys passport (i have to
admit it was in bad shape). my french isn't very good, but i
believe they where debating whether or not it was counterfeit. they
finally decided it was valid and turned to me. ""ticket and
passport"". i handed over my passport and told them that i was late
to the station and that my family was on somewhere with my ticket.
they were clearly not amused and talked to themselves. the bigger
of the two, leaned towards me while the other one was writing down
my passport information. ""he showed me the price of the ticket on
his calculator. ""i suspect your family also has your money?"". they
radioed in. ""there are no others corbin's on the train, come with
us.""<br />
<br />
the conversation to the operating switch was in a phrase: matter of
fact. the whistle began to blow. an announcement went over the
speakers. the train would be making an unscheduled stop. the
screeching of the wheels began. it took about 10 minutes for the
train to finally come to a halt. by that time, i had been escorted
to an exit point, a firm grip on my arm the entire time.<br />
<br />
the doors slid open and i was literally pushed out.<br />
<br />
outside, there was a beautiful midnight sky. in fact i had made it
about 2 hours north of paris and looking around quickly got the
impression that this was a quaint french ville, in the middle of
nowhere. the controllers were laughing and yelling obscenities that
made no sense. the train began to start. it's wheels straining
under the gigantic weight to build up to it's bullet speeds.<br />
<br />
i watched the momentum and noticed an interesting detail.<br />
<br />
it wasn't just the door that i was thrown out of that had opened.
all the doors had opened. i watched them pass me by. one by one,
each moving slightly faster and i felt hypnotized in a way that
only happens when you have made up your mind to do something crazy.
with a brave (and admittedly clumsy) leap.<br />
<br />
i was back in the train.<br />
<br />
it was dark and i soon realized that i was in first class. everyone
had their own cabins and i began making my way towards the back of
the train, hoping to find a place where i could blend in. i finally
made it as far as i could go. the door to second class was
locked...."

"she was locked out of her apartment and standing outside her door
with just the cutest button of a smile and i said that i once
trained as a locksmith and that maybe i could help. that part of
course was untrue but there are times when my mind has a mind of
its own like when i said, i do, when the priest asked 'who here
plays the organ' or when i told the older boys at my school that i
could score some hash. now i neither smoke nor set aside my sundays
for mass. but i have scaled walls to hide my pride and i have seen
more movies than a boy should have time for and so you see i
thought how difficult can this be. i took my wallet from my pocket
, my card from its row, slipped it sweet through the jamb and
popped open the door. when she turned around and hugged me, i felt
the movement of bones in my forefathers grave, that the sweat on my
brow was a jewel i should save, that a heart can melt and can still
be brave and maybe, just maybe, i had grounds to ask, would you
like to go out sometime? she took a step back , my smile fell to a
grin but it refound its girth when she said, ""won't you come in"".
one thing led to another i must have stayed for a week, i polished
my prayers and gave thanks to the saints. and now everyday when i
walk through this world, my shoulders straight, my head up high,
though i tend to embellish, i try not to lie. and when we're at
parties and you know they ask, how we got together? i tell them
twas poetry right from the start. she needed a locksmith to open

to behave because i'm a woman. i don't have dreams of settling
down, getting married and having children. it is very difficult for
me to date someone who is hardcore religious because although i

really think your way is better and that if you are nice enough to
the different person, maybe they'll see that your way is the best

youth.<br />
<br />
in the early 90s i also helped create and write an influential
ezine. the quality was terrible. the issues were never spell
checked and included horrible english, elitism, sexism, angst and
complete non-sequitors or stories that mattered to a very small

second thing which my be relevant to some of you: i spend a lot of

"i adore female divinity. i have to admit that i'm extremely
attracted to empowered women and getting lost in someone who
commands her presence. while it can be sometimes hard to admit,
it's amazing when a woman can look straight through me. i won't

when i can connect with women physically and intellectually, it

something i'm really working on. oh also, since this is sf, i

"this is a burning man story - my last year was my seventh burn, and
i went out to the basura sagrada on the night of the burn with a
friend. i had had a really hard year - working through a divorce,
an old burner lover died of an overdose, laid off from my job, a
close artistic partner had died randomly out of the blue... and
here i was at the temple reflecting on all that.<br />
i had done a tarot reading for myself recently which is generally
pretty accurate and the general reading was that i was going to
manage and balance things very well. except up there, on the temple
i didn't feel like it all. i didn't feel strong and adaptable. i
felt alone and broken down. not sure about my future. just too much
random shit happening throughout my life. so many dead friends too
young, no security, love just not working out. not like i wanted to
throw a pity party for myself, it was just all coming to head right
there. and so i'm sitting on the upper level of the temple in
ridiculously high winds and the whole structure is shaking and the
pieces of junk that the construction team has nailed to the frame
are all rattling and waving and suddenly it hits me.<br />
i'm as strong as the temple. you can take pieces of junk, things
that other people have thrown away and discarded, and turn them
into something beautiful. the wind can blow as hard as it likes,
but the structure isn't coming down. one because it's built right,
but also because there are 50 thousand people out here right now
who have put their belief, their spirit right into this thing. yes,
it's formed from all these broken things, but ultimately it's the
strongest platform on the playa. and i'm just as broken, flawed,
and as strong as the temple.<br />
<br />
and the wind stops."
"i own more nerf guns and legos than any kid you will ever meet.

also i have a stupidly large wardrobe for most guys, and more shoes
than most girls. it's pretty normal for me to just wander around
town for the afternoon in a vest and tie. i'm a little silly when
it comes to my fashion appearance i guess, heh."

by getting close, i don't let just anyone know my secrets. i guess
if you really want one, i still haven't outgrown walking the edge

"""admit"" is totally the wrong word for this question, because it
makes it about shame and guilt. some more private things i'm proud

in preparation for a date a while back, i was giving myself a

running some clippers over everything). things were going
swimmingly until i tried this slanted buzzer guard around the ear.
i don't know what it was, but something went terribly wrong. i
accidentally trimmed a patch really short over my ear, took a swath
off my sideburns, but best of all, managed to leave some nearly
horizontal lines in between said short patch and my forehead. think
vanilla ice. nice. at least my date got a big laugh out of it like
i did."

however i will admit that i hate initiating messages on this site.
my guess is that you ladies are inundated with tons of messages and
i don't really feel like competing with all that madness. i figure
if one of you contacts me, its more likely to result in a
meaningful connection than the other way around. perhaps i'm just
shooting myself in the foot, but i'm ok with that risk. :)"

"i am not immune to periodic pessimism about this whole ""dating at
my age"" thing. everyone in my cohort is older and wiser, and so we
all have loooong lists of things we want to avoid in the next
relationship, which means it's easy to treat okcupid as a
smrgsbord of (apparently) fatally flawed options to reject out of
hand. back in college, when you met someone (in person... what a
concept!) and felt mutual attraction, you just got involved and
(maybe) later worried about how to work things out for the long
term. not that i'm recommending that approach, but it often feels
like things have swung too far in the other direction...."

the true gentleman is the man whose conduct proceeds from good will
and an acute sense of propriety, and whose self-control is equal to
all emergencies; who does not make the poor man conscious of his
poverty, the obscure man of his obscurity, or any man of his
inferiority or deformity; who is himself humbled if necessity
compels him to humble another; who does not flatter wealth, cringe
before power, or boast of his own possessions or achievements; who
speaks with frankness but always with sincerity and sympathy; whose
deed follows his word; who thinks of the rights and feelings of
others, rather than his own; and who appears well in any company, a
man with whom honor is sacred and virtue safe.<br />

chivalry and true romance are not dead. i am a gentleman who has
tremendous respect for the opposite sex and i will do things like

machismo is an outdated concept and is perpetuated by men with low
self-esteem and the naive women that support them. becoming the

"i think the one and only true love is just like the absolute
truth<br />
in religion. maybe truth(and so called true love) is much like the
concept of ""limit"" in math. perhaps, you will fall for the same
type of people or a predictable set of types and you are able to do
so many times in your life. each person resonates with some part of
you. so the journey of finding love is actually finding yourself.
when we are looking for a better half, aren't we actually looking
for a better self? someone who mirrors us, who's what we admire, or
who's what we lack of.<br />
<br />
i realized the notion that you will one day meet someone who makes
you happier than ever before is simply a myth. what's more
important than being independently happy? but on the other hand, i
think the meaning of life is finding an ideal lover. admit it,
reproductive drive is hardwired in us and love is just a rational
interpretation of this instinct. what's love? maybe an aggregation
of sexual selection factors(phenotype and cultural/social
influencers), chemicals(oxytocin and vasopressin), and
probability(serendipity-such as meeting the right person at the
right time and how frequently you get to spend time with him/her).

intellectually, and socially compatible with another person? i have

i believe that our purpose here on earth is to learn how to observe
and control your own mind (not other peoples minds) and to become
more in-tune with synchronicity. i believe that dreams are tool for
becoming more in-tune with synchronicity and are very
important.<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
synchronicity is the experience of two or more events that are
apparently causally unrelated or unlikely to occur together by
chance, yet are experienced as occurring together in a meaningful
manner. the concept of synchronicity was first described in this
terminology by carl gustav jung, a swiss psychologist, in the
1920s.[1]<br />
<br />
the concept does not question, or compete with, the notion of
causality. instead it maintains that, just as events may be grouped
by cause, they may also be grouped by meaning. a grouping of events
by meaning need not have an explanation in terms of cause and
effect.<br />

i'm romantically polyamory-minded (given consent from all parties

have an abortion if e.g. a condom fails, and 2a)have sex within a
closed set of people or 2b)paranoidly check your partners'
intercourse genealogy to every relevant std test. as part of this,
you should know that while i've for-some-definition-dated a dozen
people, i've had sex with three, for a total of probably under
fifty times. if you're looking for a sexual virtuoso, you may wish
to look elsewhere :p. also, i have never had sex with someone

feather boa and a fur bikini.) and why do so many women find the
shift key so ... what exactly? bourgeois? impersonal? hegemonic?
(or is it just too much effort? really, set me straight.) does this
make me a jerk? it's silly and judgmental, i know, and i hope i
have it under control. but come on, don't you find some of these
profile tropes just a little smirk-worthy? at least i'm laughing at
the men, too. and at myself. after all, here i am chuckling at wine

also can't effectively punch someone in the balls when you've got

was the piece of literature that was most meaningful to him. and
then i immediately went and checked out dubliners from the library
and read the dead and it meant less than nothing to me. i didn't
understand it at all. what? people are at a party and they're
talking about stuff? there was a shepherd who died or something?
and i was totally devastated and thought this meant i would never
really understand my father. (incidentally, this was also about the
time my parents were like ""you can't read mists of avalon because
it has too many sex scenes"" and i totally did anyway. in your face
mom and dad). and so it turns out that eleven-year-olds aren't
really going to understand the dead, and that's okay. i think i
did, later. it will probably mean something different to me in
twenty years. life experience helps you understand literature. or
maybe the other way around. or something. whatever it was late when
i wrote this but i think i will keep it for now."

also there is a theory in cognitive science called
feature-integration theory which solves a problem called ""the
binding problem"". the binding problem asks ""if we process different
aspects of objects in different parts of our brains (color here,
location there etc), how do we bring it all back together
correctly?"" feature-integration theory suggests that we only do
this when we are paying attention to the object. that means that
when we are not, we may fall to what are known as conjunctive
illusions.<br />
<br />
an example of a conjunctive illusion can be illustrated by a test.
a person is placed in front of a computer and told to look at, and
express, different black numerals that are displayed in the center
of her field of view. outside of her field of view different
color/letter combinations are displayed such as a green ""f"" and a
pink ""j"". when a person is afterwards asked what color ""f"" was they
will very frequent misreport it as some color other than green.
that is a conjunctive illusion and that is also why it is important
to get people's attention on okcupid. in turn that is also why
people try so hard to individuate themselves, myself
included.<br />

i think that the profile percentage is a trick to get me to
keep<br />
adding to my profile, but i'm not sure why. quantity without<br />
content is worthless. i mean, take this line. i'm only writing
this<br />
to see if the next percentage point demands that i add
another<br />
1,000 characters. are you learning anything about me right
now?<br />
maybe that i like to game the system? or that, if i feel like it,
i<br />
can write about anything until i get bored or distracted.
maybe<br />
you're learning that i can't really sleep without something<br />
covering me, even if it's just a sheet. though in all fairness,
you<br />
only learned that last one because i just came out and told
you.<br />
cheater.<br />
<br />
perhaps you could learn that i have seen every episode of <a class=
""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=the%3cbr+%2f%3e%0afacts+of+life"">the<br />
facts of life</a> ever produced. it's not something that i'm<br />
particularly proud of, but hey...it's certainly something. i
mean,<br />
have <em>you</em> seen all of them? are you sure? even the
ones<br />
after mrs. garrett remarried and joined the peace corps? i
mean,<br />
nobody really liked beverly anyway, so i understand if you
stopped<br />
watching after that point. the show almost lost it for me
when<br />
edna's edibles burned down and they replaced it with over our<br />
heads. i mean, that store was way too 80s retro for me and it
was<br />
1985 at the time. neon and glass block everywhere? c'mon.<br />
<br />
i did not see the 2001 made for tv movie reunion. perhaps i
should<br />
endevour to fill the only remaining hole in my facts of life<br />
experience.<br />
<br />
by the way, it did demand another 1,000 characters, so i'm
just<br />
going to keep talking about 80s tv shows. alf was another one.
i<br />
haven't seen all of <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=alf"">alf</a>, but i did see quite a bit. in
high<br />
school, we were supposed to write a speech about the most
important<br />
moment in our lives. most people wrote about their dog dying
or<br />
their grandmother dying. there was a lot of death. i,
however,<br />
wasn't about to stand in front of the class and expose my
personal<br />
life to the ridicule of backwoods pennsylvania mouth breathers.
i<br />
did my speech on the cancellation of alf.<br />
<br />
you see, alf was canceled in the middle of a two-part episode.
the<br />
government finally found alf and, in the last moments of the
last<br />
episode, they showed up at his door. to be continued. but no,
it<br />
was canceled. i got up in front of the class and told how
this<br />
moment taught me that there was no permanence in life. all
things<br />
ended, even alf. even when i was in the middle of an episode.<br />
<br />
i have also not seen the made for tv movie reunion of alf. it
would<br />
just cheapen the experience, i think. the fate of <a class=""ilink""

remember the a-team? the a-team was cool. the van would drive<br />
through a wall, and hannibal would bust out of the back with

they're<br />
all run away. then one time they built a hot air balloon out
of<br />
garbage bags and used it to escape from prison. i don't think

near as sure of myself as some people have thought. i am also
strangely able to embrace thoughts and feelings of my own eventual
death with an amused laugh and anticipation. instinct for self
preservation? intact. foolish tendency to charge ahead fearlessly

idea of what flirting is. but seriously, one guy came up to me at a

i like to put makeup on people. (i feel like butch guys think this
is a no-no. i still go camping, drink beer and scratch my balls and
all that. plus, i build a mean deck) i usually wouldn't over
explain this but you'd be surprised that the gay neanderthal man is
still alive today. aww that makes me think of captain caveman, i
loved that<br />

hours early for practice - balls in your lap are likely and leave

games of each, collected cards, and was a san jose sharks season
ticket holder - how many thousands did i spend on that - i dont
know what i was thinking. modernly, it just doesn't thrill me
anymore. same thing with sunday comics, kinda sorta...update: i
played softball on a team of regulars ans was shocked when i belted
the ball for a home run. i dont know where that came from but it

"okay, i guess i should admit something weird, purely in the
interest of self-disclosure. but since i'm not comfortable
revealing a lot of private things to strangers, i'll go with
admitting something embarrassing, rather than private. once, while
working on a white house sketch for my sketch comedy group, i fell
asleep and had the hottest, most romantic sex dream of my life
about rahm emanuel, and ever since then, i haven't been able to
watch any media footage of him the same way since. there. now you
know.<br />
also, in case you were wondering, the sketch mutated into a sketch
about little girls who wanted to grow up to run the country, in
which white house administration officials appeared only as
dream-sequence fantasy-objects, much like the members of some kind
of boy band. they weren't themselves, but rather, only projections
of the girls' subconconscious needs and desires. as usual, i tried
to write something about someone else, and ended up writing about
myself again."

just purse your lips and whistle - that's the thing.<br />

and...always look on the bright side of life...<br />
always look on the light side of life...<br />

for life is quite absurd<br />
and death's the final word<br />
you must always face the curtain with a bow.<br />
forget about your sin - give the audience a grin<br />
enjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow.<br />

me up in an illegal fighting competition organized by a rich crazy
women that threw herself at me. eventually i made enough skrill to
help my sister in law even after she irrationally refused my help.
i suppose for added conflict, she didn't want me apart of my nieces

oddly in depth about it, so feel free to skip it! my fantasy is a
girl eating so much her belly grows noticeably (not permanently,
but for the evening) - maybe so big her pants won't button up
anymore, or her shirt gets too tight and rides up on her belly.
this will just sound ridiculous if you don't like the same thing
(which few people do, probably) but let's be honest - different
strokes for different folks! ;) oh, and i wouldn't expect someone
i'm sexually involved with to gain weight or anything, but maybe
just entertain my attraction by looking as big as possible in
whatever way suits her. in fact, a girl could be downright skinny
and still make this work - sometimes it's even sexier for a skinny
girl to stuff herself because of the contrast between her frame and
her full belly!"

particularly brutal and prolonged awkward phase, i was enjoying a
bowl of cereal, shirtless and in my tightie-whities. suddenly, i

and did a sort of duck and cover, hoping she might veer off course.
alas, she did not and rounded the corner to stumble upon me
crouching, chubby, and whimpering in my fruit of the looms. and

sleep, pretty lady, the night is enfolding you;<br />
drift, and so lightly, on crystalline streams.<br />
wrapped in its perfumes, the darkness is holding you;<br />
starlight bespangles the way of your dreams.<br />
chorus the nightingales, wistfully amorous;<br />
blessedly quiet, the blare of the day.<br />
all the sweet hours may your visions be glamorous-<br />
sleep, pretty lady, as long as you may.<br />
<br />
sleep, pretty lady, the night shall be still for you;<br />
silvered and silent, it watches you rest.<br />
each little breeze, in its eagerness, will for you<br />
murmur the melodies ancient and blest.<br />
so in the midnight does happiness capture us;<br />
morning is dim with another day's tears.<br />
give yourself sweetly to images rapturous-<br />
sleep, pretty lady, a couple of years.<br />
<br />
sleep, pretty lady, the world awaits day with you;<br />
girlish and golden, the slender young moon.<br />
grant the fond darkness its mystical way with you;<br />
morning returns to us ever too soon.<br />
roses unfold, in their loveliness, all for you;<br />
blossom the lilies for hope of your glance.<br />
when you're awake, all the men go and fall for you-<br />

"i love the webcomics order of the stick and sinfest.<br />

i'm not sure how private it is (because i'd tell you pretty early
on), but perhaps as a screening device: i grew up mormon
(officially resigned) and while i have some delightful religious
family and friends (my immediate family is amazing), i dislike
organized religion. i'm not necessarily opposed to dating someone
with spiritual or religious feelings, but if religion is an
important part of your life, we likely will not be a good match.
before coming out, i went on a mission to kobe, japan. even though
i no longer believe in religion, i'm immensely grateful for the
opportunity to go to japan and have an immersive experience in
another culture. i also married, and divorced, a very nice woman
(see, i said i identify with joe pitt). i am indescribably happier
being out, and at the same time i appreciate all that i learned
during that part of my life. if that history freaks you out, better
to have it out in the open early. but it also means i'm not going
to judge you if you have an interesting history too (i may even
prefer an interesting history because we'll have things to talk
about). besides, while the past informs who we are, the future is
still full of potential."

but here's something i haven't told anyone until typing it this
moment. about a year ago i was on one of my ridiculously long walks
around the city from the mission to ocean beach and around the
coastline of san francisco. i was walking across an empty parking
lot in the marina and a car pulled into a spot a little way ahead

you should know about me. to get everything out there, i'm really
hung up on my last boyfriend. i left him, and am still dealing with
being angry at myself for it. if he had not got a promotion, and
moved, i'd have tried to do something to win him back, but 800+
miles puts a damper on romance for me. he might want to move back,
and i would honestly jump at the chance to be with him again. that
said, i don't think it makes me the best of catches. i'm not trying
to not move on, but i fairly well stuck, as far as i can tell.
you're welcome to attempt to distract me from this disaster, but i
give you no guarantees. oh, i'm also not down with casual sex, if
that even makes sense. fun, huh. lol i probably sound kind of
crazy, but at least i'm honest."

to okcupid - still figuring out some of its features, and i was
shocked to look at the personality section and see that the only
thing it says about me is that i am ""less sexually driven"" than the
average female.<br />
<br />
i'm not sure how the okcupid algorithm works, but i would just like
to comment that i avoid many of the sex questions, because i feel a
bit strange answering them in such a public forum. i'm happy to
talk about this subject in person should we meet.<br />

clever with your ""why the hell would i put private info here"" type

"about six months after i got my first car i was driving through
town when i spotted a girl that i had a small crush on. i rolled
down the window to get her attention and ran into the car in front
of me. it was just a small tap but my engine died anyway and
wouldn't re-start. i started to push my car over to the curb get it
out of traffic. i jumped back in to step on the brake but i missed
and hit the clutch instead, running into another parked car.
needless to say, i didn't get the girl and i spent the entire
summer working to pay off the damages."

"i love succulents and this past summer i started a california
succulent collection. when hiking, i have been keeping my eyes open
for new types i don't have, then grab a sample and transplant it to
my collection. i have not taken my dorkdom to its full potential
yet though... i still need a book to properly identify them so i
can totally dork out on their scientific name.<br />
<br />
after rereading this i realized i'm not even sure why i wrote about
my love of plants here. i'm sorry plants. i'll no longer sneak
around in the dark, ignoring you, pretending in front of others
that you're not cool, i am no longer ashamed to be fascinated by
the repeating patterns of your leaves. i really like them... but
sometimes just want to shout at them to grow quicker."

"i'm a bit kinky. when i'm physically up to it i'm a mild dom who
also enjoys vanilla sex. there are things that turn me on, like
wearing leather, giving sexy orders, playacting, toys and tying
people up. i'm not extreme and it's not a big deal to me either
way, i like vanilla just as much. what i like best in kink is story
- this includes ""slash"" fiction based on various movies and tv
shows.<br />
<br />
many friends i knew years ago were slash authors. most were bright,
creative, fascinating women full of creative projects who enjoyed a
fannish subculture. if i like the source material i could wind up
getting into a new fandom because good friends introduced me to it.
i also enjoy tabletop role playing games and live action role
playing - again, depends on the setting. sex with story and
playacting doesn't even get into b&amp;d sometimes, but it's fun
and gives a lot of flavor to the vanilla.<br />
<br />
i play safe. this means safe words, safer practices, emergency
releases and every staging trick that can be used to make a
physically and emotionally safe encounter into an exciting roller
coaster that doesn't crash. i prefer discussing sex, sexuality,
boundaries and ideas long before a friendship gets to the point
where it could become physically sexual. to me it's not a forbidden
topic and i'm probably not shocked by anything you like even if i
don't share that taste.<br />
<br />
i'm also comfortable with open relationships and alternative
arrangements like consensual polyamory. ""consensual"" is the big
word there. i don't believe in dishonesty, jealousy or double
standards. i'd rather be real and learn to trust my partner for
real. what happens in a story is the story - what happens in real
life in a relationship is equality and respect."

pretend that it didn't hurt, but i was only lying to myself. in

any ""normal"" answer so in an unguarded moment i shared the honest
answer that came to me. ""strength,"" i said. ""...and
weakness.""<br />

she thought that was an incredibly sexy answer. but i guess it gets
at the truth. good sex is about power exchange, giving up power,
taking power, sharing power, in the context of an intoxicating
cocktail of sex hormones and the necessity of trust between lovers.
still sound like fun? and good intimacy is the same: about being
vulnerable, and being protective, in the context of mutual respect.

harder, but i'm ready."

it might be the closest i'd ever get to actually having one. at
this point i've been doing it for a number of years now and have an
amazing collection of drawn or painted pianos done on anything from
cocktail napkins to big canvases. i even have one painted on a

i perform at storytelling events in the bay area and on the off
chance that you've made it this far to read this paragraph - below

storytelling (a great event every 1st wed of the month). not that
you want to spend 20 minutes listening to me tell a story but you
can probably glean way more about me, my life &amp; my personality

*if you don't already - make sure that you floss regularly. yes,

heart flutter like woven floss but if you choose to use waxed
floss, that's fine too. i won't judge you.<br />

did i also mention that i'm half-deaf due to an awkward encounter
with an indian ear cleaner in delhi? right about now, you're
probably thinking, ""wow, toothless &amp; half-deaf? awesome! what a
catch!""...just before you delete the email i sent you but what can
you do? life happens &amp; you have to deal with it. having a sense
of humor along the way certainly helps. of course, being toothless
&amp; half-deaf before your 30th birthday is as close to a karmic
mandate as you can get for having a strong sense of humor. these
and other life experiences have also made me wonderfully grounded."

create (absolutely, who knew) .... tom robbins refers to them as
the devils temple .... noam chomsky refers to them as ""the

<br />
 oh my god i cannot be a comedian. i love to make people laugh but
i'm just not funny enough. (it's okay, we can joke about
this.)<br />
 i would still like to be a husband someday, but it's not urgent,
at all, and honestly i think my key motivation at that point was so
i could have sex  hmm, turns out you really don't need that ring
to get it on!<br />
 scientist? i suppose i turned out more like an engineer, though
hopefully i will be doing user experience research. and i do have a
scientist's worldview: skeptical, irreligious, somewhat fact-based,
willing to make and admit to mistakes, interested to learn
more.<br />
 i guess you could call me an inventor if you count web apps. i
don't think third-grade me would have. sorry, little guy.<br />
 astronaut  that dream kinda died when i realized you generally
have to go through the air force *and* have perfect physical
condition *and* get along *just fine* with a crew of people you
could be with in a supremely tiny space (again, no pun intended)
for potentially weeks (or months, if we're talking about that
mission to mars that third-grade me would have killed to go on) 
dude, tall order. i'm not a pessimist, but how rosy do your glasses
have to be to not get a little grumpy locked in a flying sardine
can, right?"
i'm ridiculously handsome in reality.
i will laugh at most things even if i don't find it funny.
for me to know and for u to find out ;)

missing again. this happens all the time. it's detachable. this
comes in handy a lot of the time. i can leave it home when i think
it's going to get me in trouble, or i can rent it out when i don't
need it. but now and then i go to a party, get drunk, and the next
morning i can't, for the life of me, remember what i did with it.
first i looked around my apartment and i couldn't find it, so i
called up the place where the party was, they hadn't seen it
either. i asked them to check the medicine cabinet 'cause, for some
reason, i leave it there sometimes, but not this time. so i told
them if it pops up to let me know. i called a few people who were
at the party, but they were no help either. i was starting to get
desperate. i really don't like being without my penis for too long.
it makes me feel like less of a man and i really hate to have to
sit down every time i take a leak. after a few hours of searching
the house and calling everyone i could think of, i was starting to
get very depressed, so i went to the kiev and ate breakfast. then
as i walked down second avenue toward st. mark's place, where all
those people sell used books and other junk on the street, i saw my
penis lying on a blanket next to a broken toaster oven. some guy
was selling it. i had to buy it off him. he wanted 22 bucks, but i
talked him down to 17. i took it home, washed it off, and put it
back on. i was happy again. complete. people sometimes tell me i
should get it permanently attached, but i don't know. even though
sometimes it's a pain in the ass, i like having a detachable penis."

decorated shoebox, hidden in my room. i like looking at them, years
after they've happened. the oldest ticket i have is from panic! at
the disco when i was 14 or 15 and then spice girls a year later. i
like to keep random stuff in general. flyers for events, handmade
cards, shoeboxes, concert posters from the fillmore, a rainbow
feather boa that was thrown at me during a goldfrapp concert, a
madonna cd that my grandma bought for me when i was 5 and i've kept
it ever since. i'm weird like that. :p"

""couldn't"" stop) and also frees them from having to own the ""dirty""
behavior (i.e. ""he wanted it"").<br />

i don't do any ""body grooming"" but would probably wax pretty much
anything for the right person. heck, if it turns you on and you
know what you're doing you could do the waxing. just don't suggest
shaving--shaving sucks in so many ways. i only shave my face once a
week (unless there's something special going on) and that's only
because having a beard is more annoying than shaving. but my skin
is kind of sensitive so shaving gives me rashes and ingrown hair.
maybe i should do something more permanent about it--like laser
treatment.<br />

for the same reason (sensitive skin) i don't have tattoos and
probably wouldn't get any. i'm currently using piercing for
self-expression.<br />

"at my old job, before i started grad school, my company had
private, single person full bathrooms, complete with a shower and
everything, the whole 9 yards. very luxurious.<br />
<br />
any time nature called, i liked to use the private bathroom, who
wants to go no2 in a room with other people? not this guy.<br />
<br />
one summer day i visited the restroom, but i was wearing a nice
dress shirt, without an undershirt. i didn't want to get it all
wrinkled... so i thought --- i'll hang up my dress shirt and go
shirtless, why not?<br />
<br />
greatest decision of my life. you have not lived until you've gone
to the bathroom shirtless. after that day i never looked back.
first thing i did from then on was take my shirt off before taking
a seat.<br />
<br />
the story, however, doesn't end here. things seemed great for a
while, work was going well, shirtless pooping, what more could i
ask for? until one day, i forgot to lock the door. was this the
first time i forgot to lock the door? we'll never know, but the
events that followed changed everything.<br />
<br />
someone walked in on me. and as a reminder to those who skipped
ahead, i'm sitting on the toilet shirtless, profile view for the
person walking in on me. after a brief, ""whoa! i'm sorry"" and
shutting of the door, the encounter was over. but the damage had
been done.<br />
<br />
for the next year, my coworker wouldn't make eye contact with me
whenever he passed me in the hall. i'd go to the bar, and tell the
story to whoever would listen, while staring at the bottom of my
pint glass.<br />
<br />
""he thinks i'm some weirdo who poops naked!"" i'd cry out. ""if he
only knew the whole story, he would understand...""<br />
<br />
i'm sure you want to know how the story ends, but you'll have to
come have a drink with me before i'll tell you."

'tis a tragic story, if you wish to humor this lady's tale.<br />
<br />
it began in the summer of 1894, where edward norton still ruled
san<br />
francisco and tea time was not disrespected as it is today.
in<br />
fact, twas the best year for tea times, before sir rutherman
iii<br />
took that nasty fall involving the tribals and the oriental
ghost<br />
upon the bungalow in paris in the february of '95 and sir
gahveryly<br />
took over and popularized all those ghastly reforms. but i
digress.<br />
i was dallying the pages of the okcupid, admiring the sights
(as<br />
much as a fine lady can admire the mish mash of cads,
hooligans,<br />
and boorish louts), when a gentleman called upon my doorstep,<br />
leaving a telegram of awkward proposals and a date upon a
zeppelin.<br />
although awkward and fumbling i was none too offended by his<br />
demeanor, nor did he completely lack of charm, so we arranged
to<br />
meet by zeppelin on the saturday of the week.<br />
<br />
we met upon the zeppelin, admired the peaks and valleys of
san<br />
francisco, drank tea, and discussed the current policies put
forth<br />
by edward norton recently concerning kittens and galvanic<br />
equipment. things were rather tepid for the most part, my
gentleman<br />
companion, some paul v brown or somesuch, until a vicious sky<br />
pirate came upon us! using his air dirigible, his motley crew<br />
raided our luxury craft and went about looting and stealing
all<br />
they could get their grubby hands on.<br />
<br />
oh! but the captain! that captain of the ship! how dashing he
was!<br />
unlike the filthy curs going every which way laying their
grubby<br />
hands on any treasure, he stood above them like some
beautiful<br />
marble david, as if the world were some mighty goliath he
just<br />
slain. whether it be confidence or arrogance smitten across
his<br />
face, i knew that his soul was forever smitten upon my heart.
some<br />
such reason could be why my mouth spoke these words before i
could<br />
even stop myself:<br />
<br />
""oh pirate! you can plunder the gold, steal the treasures,
ransack<br />
the reserves! but i will not be satisfied unless you whisk me
away<br />
upon your mighty vessel!""<br />
<br />
i instantly covered my mouth and moved back to hide. but 'twas
too<br />
late; his gaze met mine, and he slowly walked, with swagger
and<br />
glamour towards me. i could do nothing, i was paralyzed, my
heart<br />
was pounding out of passion or fear i knew not but my gentleman
was<br />
absolutely terrified. ""back, scoundrel!"" he shouted as he drew
his<br />
rapier, but the pirate king merely slapped it aside with nary
a<br />
thought then lay a good left hook across his face. while
impressed<br />
by my friend's momentary courage, i swooned at the pirate;s<br />
virility. soon i was in his arms and whisked back upon his<br />
airship.<br />
<br />
i joined the pirate king on his many voyages across the sky
for<br />
several months as a impassioned companion and partner in crime.
we<br />
raided, we loved, we sang and drank and ate, and he made sure
not<br />
another pirate layed even a finger upon me. while surrounded
by<br />
dogs, he was more of a gentleman than any mainland ponce.
something<br />
though always pried in the back of my mind, a worm of doubt
that<br />
wriggled through the apple of my paradise. for you see, at
least<br />
once a day my pirate king would disappear for perhaps an hour
or<br />
two on end every day, unable to be found anywhere i could get
to<br />
upon the ship.<br />
<br />
one day, when we were to have tea upon the poop deck of the
ship,<br />
he was absent. i inquired around the ship for his presence but
none<br />
knew where he was. so i pilfered the desk at our quarters
(being<br />
now a pirate queen i have learned a little of loose
moralities),<br />
and found upon a hidden drawer a key to the hold that i've
never<br />
seen before. there was one chamber in the hold that was
perpetually<br />
locked; while perplexing i knew not to push my curiosities too
far.<br />
but however, on this day, my instincts told me that i must
discover<br />
what was behind that door. so down i went, putting key to lock,
and<br />
discovering what lay behind the forbidden door...<br />
<br />
oh the shock! the horror! there was paul v green or somesuch
there<br />
clad in the most revealing and unusual of black leather
garment,<br />
and my dear pirate king bent over like some serf licking his
boots!<br />
i almost didn't recognize my dear as he had on some
horrendous<br />
leather mask but i could tell from the depths of the eyes behind
it<br />
that it was indeed my love, my companion scoundrel ruler. for i
was<br />
not the only one stolen from the zeppelin on that fateful day,
but<br />
so was my gentleman caller! and there he was, partaking in
some<br />
horrid ritual of servitude and utter debauchery! i left,
tears<br />
streaming down my eyes and a virulent mixture of rage and
bitter<br />
betrayal brewing a toxic concoction upon my soul.<br />
<br />
i stole a life ship and as much loot as i could sneak off
that<br />
night. i made a new name and a new life. i returned to the
annals<br />
of the okcupid. but lo and behold, on my return to society, i<br />
discovered the profile of the very same pirate king upon my<br />
okcupid, who in fact showed up as a ""similar user"" to the
paul<br />
whatshisname! similar except he was marked as ""more kinky"",
and<br />
marked as ""bi"" and ""available""! oh, the shame i felt! to be
turned<br />
aside in favor of a kink-gaylord-fancy-nancy! my heart has
been<br />
irreparable to this day, which is why i have cast off from
the<br />
harbor of okcupid to set sail and swear off the lands of love
and<br />
caring forever."

"i have this fantasy: i meet a lovely woman. a certain of number of
dates follow. on the one in question we share a good bottle of wine
and conversation. we find ourselves at your place and topping the
pile of your to be read pile of books is the pale king, a book i
have mixed feelings about. i pick it up and you notice and then we
find ourselves in a most intimate conversation, and then..."

"i don't cry often, but i cry at the most ridiculous things. like

"what do people fill out in this section? one ear is smaller than
the other (i don't know if this is true for me, if it is, it's not

people away. hmmmmm"

i love to take long showers.
i just told you i'm in an open marriage-- you want more?
"well, i'm going to do something here and be completely honest about
something i've never been completely honest about before. i'm sure
that it's a terrible idea, and that in the end i'm going to regret
it, but here goes anyways.<br />
<br />
ever since i was little, i've always been interested in
crossdressing.<br />
<br />
okay, yes, i know, weird. it really doesn't mesh with any other
aspect of my personality. if anyone who knows me ever happens to
read this, i'm sure i'll never hear the end of it.<br />
<br />
but it won't go away. for years (literally) i've done my best to
just kind of ignore it, hoping it would just up and leave me alone.
i've had little outbursts where i could sort of express it in
limited doses, and after these doses all urges would disappear for
about a week, before coming back full force later on. so since
ignoring it has done absolutely nothing but make it worse, i'm
trying out a new strategy. einstein once said that the definition
of insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting
different results. well, i figure i'm insane enough at this point
so i might as well go in the opposite direction.<br />
<br />
so here i am. i guess i should sort of clarify a bit. i don't want
to be a girl, i'm just a boy who likes girls clothes. i'm not
particularly feminine, and i'm not flamboyant in the least, so it's
hard to justify to people that know me.<br />
<br />
also, it's hard to justify to myself considering my own
personality. i'm a fighter at heart. i love conflict, and i love
pitting myself against other people be it in actual physical
contests, or in debates or other such arenas. these urges go
against pretty much everything i am, or so i tell myself.<br />
<br />
despite all this, i might as well try it and see what happens. i
would like to meet people who either are interested in the same, or
who just like people like me. my ideal boyfriend would probably
like me doing it, who might even push me to do it, but isn't
interested in doing it himself. i'm completely new to it. i've
never dressed up and gone out in any seriousness, i don't have any
clothes, and i don't really know where to start.<br />
<br />
the reason i'm even putting this on here is that i don't think it's
very fair of me to not have any mention of it on such a personal
website as this where i may possibly meet a guy that i could end up
dating. and who knows, maybe someone is out there just as crazy as
me, and actually likes it or finds it attractive. i figure, it's
san francisco, i'm sure there are all types here."
"aks me, but be ready to hear an answer! :p"

"my mother passed away when i was just 16, she was my soul-mate.
which sounds strange to say, but i believe you can meet someone in
your life who's soul echoes your own, and my mother was that
person. we were so close we finished eachothers sentences, spent
almost every waking moment together, and could just sit and talk
for hours on end about nothing in particular. losing her was the
hardest thing i have ever been through in my life, and i miss her
more than anyone could know. i will never love anyone as much as my
mother."
"i liked 99 guys and dated a few but i also dated one girl.

thing, but i am not afraid of taking a chance to meet someone

when i was in japan, i picked up a word in the kansai dialect of
japanese, ""meccha"", which basically means ""very"". despite this, i
have actively avoided picking up saying ""hella"" on the west coast,
in part because i see it on t-shirts and occupy decided that ""hella
hella occupy"" would be a good chant.<br />
<br />
and for those of you who speak japanese: i once was really drunk in
a karaoke place in japan, and was trying to stumble back into the
room where my friends were. i ended up opening the wrong door, and
found three japanese girls sitting in there. i looked around for at
least 30 seconds, thinking my friends might have pulled in some
other people. eventually, i realized my mistake and said with the
strongest drunken american accent possible <br />

"i have started an obedience school for disobedient girls. strong,
smart, independent women only need apply. the ideal student: you
are not afraid of life, you are eager to experience all that your
womanhood has to offer, and you are ready to express it in the
appropriate setting. you enjoy making yourself attractive and
feeling feminine, and, though aware of sexism, you like being
objectified in the right context, and you wish more guys knew what
they wanted and did it without apology or anxiety. you expect men
to be considerate, polite, respectful, stylish, and open-minded,
but -- most importantly -- you are tired of making all the
decisions in bed. you can stand your ground in conversation and
enjoy lively discussion, but you are flexible and not
argumentative. your fondest desire is to be manhandled by a
dominant gentleman -- gentlemanhandled. you are guided by your
heart and mind, and you recognize that your body is a gift to
enjoy. you strive to improve yourself, but do not fret over things
you cannot change. in short, you are a woman of the future."

i absolutely love well-directed and intelligent sarcasm and dark
humour, but i like when people know when to actually slow down and
open up, too. you dont need to be a girly girl, but i do like sweet
girls. with soft hearts. and big smiles. if you are sharp and
angular in your disposition, or are absolutely 100% right in 90% of
the discussions you get in, the chances of us hitting it off are
probably pretty low. :) they say its not how someone feels about
you that makes you stick around, or even how you feel about them,
its how they make you feel about yourself. i like emotional
equality. both people should want to stick around to edify and
build up the other, as an uncontrollable drive. that being said, i
am a sucker for a smartass geniuses.<br />
<br />
well, it's not private, but i'm funnier than my profile lets on.

morning screening of a movie, and i was way overcaffeinated from
drinking too-strong tea and just had to let it go. the date
continued, but there wasn't a second one after it. however, we're

end up in relationships that give me more freedom to be who i am.

spiritual questions, such as okc asks, and adhering to any specific
formalized belief system or parroting others' teachings, then by
those measures, i am ""not spiritual."" on the other hand, if you
look at the way i live my life and the way i connect with others,
you might reach a different conclusion. but, as a native new
yorker, i shy away from ""spiritual"" terminology and jargon. at the
health and harmony festival, a wonderful friend of mine, after she
performed on the goddess stage, introduced me to her friends as
""the male version of a goddess."" i kid you not. she told me later,
that was her way of saying that i'm spiritual. so, i might actually

"i'm a top. ok ok, how about 25 random things i'm not too
embarrassed to admit:<br />
<br />
1. i've hung out on separate occasions with two different members
of the village people. several years ago i had the pleasure of
spending the afternoon with filipe rose (the indian) during san
francisco's pride celebration. years later, after attending a 'very
merry disco christmas' at the castro theater, i got the opportunity
to hang out with randy jones (the cowboy) who was both incredibly
sweet and very personable. to this day ""can't stop the music""
remains one of my favorite movies of all time. i feel fortunate i
was able to see the original village people perform in concert in
vancouver many moons ago.<br />
<br />
2. i played baby garfield in an elementary school musical
production. i even had a solo singing part! i don't remember much
about the experience except i rather over-acted through the whole
thing. it would be the end of my acting career.<br />
<br />
3. i love horror movies! i can watch the most gory, stomach-turning
films without having nightmares and yet i have arachnophobia. if
you want to see me lose it, watch arachnophobia with me one night
and watch me freak out. i can't stand spiders.<br />
<br />
4. i am a total kid at heart. i can spend hours in novelty gift and
toy stores. i still love to go to amusement parks and ride roller
coasters.<br />
<br />
5. i dream of one day owning a modern home like something out of
the pages of dwell. the design within reach catalog is my idea of
porn.<br />
<br />
6. when i was a child my brother and sisters told me i was adopted
and made me cry.<br />
<br />
7. my feelings are hurt easily.<br />
<br />
8. i am addicted to reality tv. i can't get enough of it. i love it
all--project runway, real housewives, america's next top model, top
chef, american idol, celebrity apprentice, wife swap, survivor--you
name it. if it's reality tv, chances are i've got a season pass on
my tivo.<br />
<br />
9. i love the 80s!--the music, the movies, the fashion. i still
love watching reruns of degrassi junior high and get excited
watching a good john hughes film. sixteen candles, the breakfast
club, and pretty in pink are my coming-of-age movies. i'm thrilled
to have had the opportunity to see some of my favorite artists in
concert over the past few years: human league, duran duran, abc,
howard jones, dead or alive, berlin, pet shop boys, erasure.<br />
<br />
10. i used to go out dancing in the most embarrassing outfits when
i was younger. the pice de rsistance was going out clubbing in a
jockstrap with a pair of bare-assed chaps in the middle of a
snowstorm. to this day, i wonder what on earth i was
thinking.<br />
<br />
11. i don't want to grow up.<br />
<br />
12. i still get excited when i find out bananarama are releasing a
new single.<br />
<br />
13. my mother once made me order her the flowbee, an electric
powered vacuum attachment made for cutting hair. to my horror i
actually ordered it, but fortunately it never arrived.<br />
<br />
14. i was upset when wham split up.<br />
<br />
15. when i was 19, i drank an entire bottle of red wine before a
night out dancing. before i could make it to the club i proceeded
to throw up in my best friend's car. i am thankful she forgave me.
and to my brother who had to clean up the mess. those white denim
jeans would never be the same.<br />
<br />
16. i still enjoy watching cartoons. i believe that sid &amp; marty
krofft and pee wee herman are underrated geniuses.<br />
<br />
17. i get lost easily. it's painfully embarrassing. i have no sense
of direction and am usually clueless to my whereabouts. i read maps
upside-down.<br />
<br />
18. i have no idea what i am doing with my life and that terrifies
me.<br />
<br />
19. i have a brother a year older than myself, who many people
mistake for my twin. we look alike, sound alike, and act alike. we
are so similar but completely different.<br />
<br />
20. i once went to a triple feature of rollerboogie, xanadu, and
skatetown usa. it was one of the best nights of my life.<br />
<br />
21. i do not cook. everything i eat is either frozen, boiled,
canned, or takeout. tragic.<br />
<br />
22. i miss living in vancouver all the time. not a day goes by that
i don't think about what it'd be like if i moved back.<br />
<br />
23. i am secretly envious of happy couples.<br />
<br />

disclose it to potential partners and now to you as well. while on
this subject i'd like to say... speak up people! even if you are
clear of std's, ask first before engaging in sexual conduct with
someone. i am perpetually frustrated that i am the first to address
this subject with intimate partners. i would love to see safe sex
conversations become as common and as easy to have as asking
someone what they want to eat for dinner, which, by the way, is not
a bad time to bring it up. i myself always try to slip it into
conversation when people are thinking clearly and not in the heat

"i have a sweet mix cd of 80s monster ballads i made for a road trip
back in 2001. i know nearly every word of every song. you don't

peter gabriel's smash hit, 'in your eyes', while cruising on the

i'm really quite torn about this site. a part of me wants to see
what okc has to offer, another part of me has been underwhelmed by
the site. i guess you get out of this what you put in. so, i've

attribute it to the crushing hunger i sometimes experienced in my
backpacker days - occasionally stranded in a remote village having
the unlikely delicacy of camel fat or goat head offered to me. as
such, i learned to always have some munch-able on me. over time
it's become a wee bit compulsive; bits of random food can be found

competitive about boardgames to the point of cheating and
unintentional injury.<br />

my sister and dad once rolled off our deck (a 4-foot drop) while

both looking ashamed and both still clutching the spoon.<br />

the first night we met my future brother-in-law, my mom and i

because of the cold in this city, i'm pretty open to the idea of
lots of cuddling at the moment :p<br />
<br />
besides that, i'm an extremely public person. in fact i'm a big
believer that everyone should be more public because it creates
connections and breeds tolerance. there's not much other than those
things that occur in the bedroom that i'm not willing to admit
publicly. most of my opinions on a variety of subjects are public
and you can find out a lot about me by simply searching for my full
name, ""andrew de andrade"".<br />
<br />
on the topic of publicness, i highly encourage everyone to watch
jeff jarvis' brilliant presentation ""publicness, privacy and
penises"" that he gave at the re:publica conference in germany in
2010. i've yet to see a more compelling argument for the publicness
than that. it was so well-received that it made it to the front
page of three major german newspapers the following day. here's the
link:
http://www.buzzmachine.com/2010/04/22/privacy-publicness-penises/<br />

<br />
in fact, i'd say that okcupid is a perfect example of the value of

"i've gone through various stages with this question as i have with
others on this list so here is the latest and perhaps most
challenging for me to share though now that i have decided to share
it, it's not so difficult.<br />
<br />
i have been going to psychoanalysis for three years now several
times a week. a reason i have resisted sharing this is because most
people know and understand little about psychoanalysis, let alone
therapy. this is understandable as most people will not go to
therapy, again, let alone psychoanalysis because of various fears,
apprehensions or anxieties that arise within them. part of this, in
my opinion, is because they do not want to see or understand
certain things about themselves, the world around them and their
relationships or lack thereof. of course there are the issues of
time, energy and/or means to commit to this intensive
process.<br />
<br />
the main reason for why i go to analysis and for that matter, so
frequently, is because like a rock climber or deep sea diver, i
find the process of self-awareness, self-discovery and
self-knowledge to be exciting, fascinating, scary, intense and
educational. why not go climbing and diving into one's psyche if
one finds the process worthwhile?<br />
<br />
i enjoy the challenge of analyzing my feelings, reactions,
thoughts, my mind's process, my interactions with others, my past,
the present and the future.<br />
<br />
as socrates said, ""the unexamined life is not worth living""."
"well it aint the most private but will say this...<br />
sometimes i sleep...<br />
and sometimes you can have a conversation with me while i do it..."
"i don't drink, like not at all. the bar scene isn't really for me,
been there done that.<br />
<br />
also, my spirituality is the most important thing to me. i wouldn't
say i'm ""religious"" but that i have a strong spiritual faith that
works for me. self-examination, prayer, meditation and giving of
myself to others keep me connected to a god of my understanding."
""
i can't tell if you're being sarcastic.

"if i were to admit something private here, it would no longer be
private, right? however, i do have a funny story to make up for
it.<br />
<br />
as a kid, i liked to eat peanut butter m&amp;m's and spaghetti-o's.
remember those? since they both tasted good, i wondered if they
would both taste even better together. so one day, i heated a bowl
of spaghetti-o's and added a few peanut butter m&amp;m's to it. i
thought it was cool how the food coloring from the candy shell was
melting into the tomato cheese sauce; the colors were really
pretty. i stuck my spoon into the peanut butter
m&amp;m's/spaghetti-o's mixture, and scooped a spoonful of it into
my mouth. it tasted fine at first, but after the candy shell
dissolved, it was one of the worst things i had ever tasted! i
really didn't want to finish my spaghetti-o's, but at the same
time, i didn't want to waste it. i reluctantly finished it, but by
then, i was ready to puke. consequently, i promised myself never to
do that again.<br />
<br />
as a side note, i do think that fruit roll-ups and m&amp;m's taste
great together."

"i work out to the world's most embarrassing collection of pop

i still like playing with legos.
"every like 2 months or so i listen to blink 182 again. and not like

non-disclosure form with ... well, i can't say. you know - because
it's a non-disclosure agreement and all.<br />

however, i'll take this opportunity to share a story that's pretty
embarrassing, but mostly really funny (at least i think so):<br />
once upon a time, many years ago, i was on a blind' date with a
guy i'd met online  we were at one of my favorite bars (i mention
this because i should've known the landscape well). i went to get
us a few beers and on my way back, i forgot about the little step
up to where we were sitting. i tripped in a spectacular fashion.
went down like you read about. beers hit the ground and so did i. i
laughed my ass off. but here's the best part  steel yourself: he
didn't even notice because he was on the phone with another woman
he met online that he was sweet on. no, i'm not kidding. you can't
make something like that up. or at least i couldn't. (we actually
ended up being friends. and i counseled him on his pursuit of said
woman. that's how i roll ...)"

conversation, i'll add that i was married once before.
unfortunately, we ended up not being right for one another and it
ended as amicably as these things can. we are still friends and

when i was 17 or so a homeless man stopped me on the way home from
school and asked me for some change or food. i had neither. while i
was standing there waiting for the bus he went on to tell me that
he had played football at cal, was one of the founding members of
the sproul plaza drum circles, and had a daughter that he hadn't
seen in three years. after a few minutes, he asked me to walk with
him to a church a block away, where he was going to ask for help.
he wanted to walk ""with a friend"", even if that friend was a
complete stranger. i didn't know quite how to react. i went along
with him. the traffic was bad that day, as officer jim guelffs
funeral was going on at st. marys up the street. we talked about it
for a minute, and then he looks at me and says ""i don't care about
that cop, you know why? 'cause good people like you and me die
every day."" i learned that day that 1.) i am a good person and 2.)
in the grand scheme of things, my death won't matter much. i remind
myself of these things often.<br />

my mini-me decided she wants to learn to play the clarinet in band
at school. this got me thinkin, when i was little ... roun 2nd or
3rd grade, i used to tell my pops i wanted to play the sax cuz i
wanted to make people cry. when i finally got to play an
instrument, all the school had left was a damn trumpet. i tried it
... for a couple weeks! i gave up on it cuz it hurt like hell ...
made my lips all numb n shit. (i really think it was because i had
my heart set on that damn sax) as i got older, i wished i never
gave up on it cuz the horn is so damn groovy. so ... as of
8/something/11 i decided, phuckit and went n got me a trumpet. i
think these big-ass lips of mine may be a lil too big for the damn
thing though ... i cant seem to fit'em onto the mouth piece
correctly ... after only a few minutes of practicing, i end up with
the entire trumpet stickin out of my mouth like a fhuck'en lolly
pop! i'm sure i'll get this thing figured out soon enough!"

knew me and was afraid of me, and one day my dad said ""stevie, you

dinosaur and get a job""."

an outstanding relationship is most important to me (and always has
been.) at 30, 34 and again at 38 i made decisions not to marry my
serious boyfriends at the time despite the increasingly loud
ticking of that unfortunate biological clock. a nice upside to
