"synchronicity<br />
<br />
there is this whole other realm where the fabrics of our life
stories intersect as they dance and play in a magical burst of
energy. this realm doesn't need you to believe in it in order to
maintain. it is a cluster of synchronicities and happenings. it is
a gift to those who notice them. something to be treasured
appreciated. there is something special in each and every moment
that you experience in your daily waking life. this something
brings us back to the age old question: if a tree falls in the
forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? this
works in the same way. if you are not consciously there to hear it,
see it, taste it, smell it, feel it none of this matters, it's
still there. pay attention to the little things, those that are
often overlooked. see if you can find the magic in this gift we
call life."

find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you
back when you hang up on him, who will lie under the stars and
listen to your heartbeat, or will stay awake just to watch you
sleep... wait for the boy who kisses your forehead, who wants to
show you off to the world when you are in sweats, who holds your
hand in front of his friends, who thinks you're just as pretty
without makeup on. one who is constantly reminding you of how much
he cares and how lucky he is to have you.... the one who turns to
his friends and says, 'that's her.'<br />

<br />
here's an excellent dan savage rant that lines up with my opinions
on the matter:<br />
<em><br />
we have put a lie at the heart of all of our long-term romantic
relationships and then we wonder why they fall apart. two people
are looking at each other and lying to each other every day about
something very important, and they both know that the other is
lying every day. then they don't trust each other, oddly enough,
after all that lying back and forth.<br />
<br />
it's so much healthier just to acknowledge, even if you are going
to make a monogamous commitment, that that is going to be an effort
and there will be consequences to that...if we continue to define
cheating on each other as a divorce-level, breakup-level offense,
we are packing our relationships with dynamite and blowing them up
over and over and over again.<br /></em><a href=""http://kinseyconfidential.org/dan-savage-3-non-monogamous/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">[link]</a> (i also like the bit about paternal
anxiety and monogomy having been imposed as a means to control
women.)<br />

<a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl;dr"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tl;dr</a>: i am open to trying out non-monogamous

comforting buffer of belief shielding my little 10-year old brain
from the yawning chasm of existential despair. i mean, now the
neurons are firing and thinking these thoughts! these! right now!
but sometime, they will just... stop. that thought was the worst. i
just imagined a roiling, endless, inchoate blackness everywhere,
the absence of thought, and it made the pit of my stomach feel like
it was dropping. there was nothing i could do about it! it's awful!
i like living and i don't want to stop!<br />

moment or anything, but more just accepting over time that you
can't spend energy worrying about things that are outside of your
control.<br />

nowadays, i like to imagine how many fifth-graders i could take in
a fight. like we're on a field, and there's an infinite number of
them, and they're all rabid and trying to kill me, and i have to
put down as many as i can before i succumb. i'm thinking i'm 6'1,
180, i'm in pretty decent shape, i should be able to get at least
25 as long as i can keep upright and stop too many from hanging

sense that it was built for the industrial revolution where they
needed manpower to do repetitive tasks. now that we have computers
and robots, humanity shouldn't have to be relegated to those tasks.
instead we should be pushing forward. have you ever wondered why
we're never actually taught how to learn things? we're kind of left
to figure it out on our own as we try to cope with the material we
have to memorize and reiterate for tests. there's so much that

to practice my craft most days of the week. the local startup i
work for really values my contribution and provides a kick-ass work

on in this world -- i want todo it all. whether it's learning
something new or going to some exotic location, life is too short
to be a casual observer. in the past i've taken salsa and
glass-blowing lessons. recently i joined a gym where i'm learning
rock climbing and yoga. this past year i've been able to travel to
peru, kauai, and thailand. next year i'm hoping to go to
japan.<br />

<br />
my sexuality....i label myself as being a bisexual because it is
most fitting...do i have a certain preference for a mate? no, i am
attracted to characters and personalities. if you really think
about it you don't have to be in a relationship with someone, you
don't have to get married, you don't have to be intimate with the
opposite or same sex, you don't have to have kids, and take a look
at your values and beliefs and think about where they have stemmed
from....do you really feel that way or has someone/something in
your life influenced you enough to make you think that way. the
only reason why i think about this often is because it is very hard
to find understanding people. once straight girls find out i'm
bisexual it is an instant deal breaker... once straight guys find
out they don't want to have anything to do with me because (i
assume) they think i am going to hit on them, and even gay guys
think it is disgusting i would even consider being with a girl or
belittle me and tell me that i just don't want to admit that i am
gay......and while some stereotypes exist about bisexuals i am very
faithful and loyal...<br />
<br />
...my point is...give me a chance, i am here to make friends as
well. i am a really fun person to hang out with...take a
chance...live your life :)<br />

manure fertilizes the plants and so on, so the contemplation of
death and the acceptance of death is very highly generative of
creating life. you'll get wonderful things out of that. and the
other thing to contemplate is to follow the possibility of the idea
that you are totally selfish. that you don't have a good thing to
be said for you at all; you are a complete, utter rascal.<br />

"all kinds of crazy shit. politics, religion, and anything else that
people believe in, but someone has to be wrong. also etymology, why

the last question is often unusual, and sometimes delicious.<br />
<br />
at this point i will start rambling the sort of thing that passes
through my head.<br />
<br />
i sometimes find the most useful description of someone's position
is the offensively exaggerated/oversimplified one, used by their
critics such as those commie homo hippies or them gun totin' bible
thumpers. my favorite of these is ""the blandest propagandist""
(npr). i also often find these terms amusing.<br />
<br />
i've also leaped to the conclusion that the difference between
decent pizza and great pizza is a lot more garlic.<br />
<br />
i sometimes like to ponder the distinction between very similar
words, like jealousy and envy. one can be jealous of their
significant other, or their possessions, in that they do not wish
to lose them, as a dragon jealously guards its treasure. one can be
envious, on the other hand, of someone else having a more
attractive significant other, or bank account, etc. that being
said, i think that jealousy is a trait that gets a worse reputation
than it deserves. there's the down side that jealousy can imply a
certain amount of mistrust of one's partner, or feeling possessive,
but it also comes from very strong feelings for them. i feel like
i'm rambling away from anything like a point there, so i'll stop
that now."
"things i know to be apparent. i try not to stress my brain on
things i can't and will never know or understand. it's not that i
choose not think about it. it's not that i don't care to think

about it. my mind is a crazy place."

<br />
hi! you don't really know who i am, and in the grand macrocosmic
scheme of things, my own little microcosm doesn't matter anyway.
that's okay.<br />
<br />
what matters is the fact that i'm grateful to you for the events
that have transpired in my life and the people who have helped me
become who i am today. these events were not particularly pleasant
to live through (by any measure or stretch of the imagination). i
find it beautiful and bittersweet that the same universe that put
me through those events through no fault of my own also gave me the
help and strength i need to have survived them. despite the chaos
and suffering that seems to permeate your surface, your sense of
humor and beauty is not lost on me.<br />
<br />
and lets face it, the truth is that none of this matters any more
than we choose for it to matter. that makes things kinda
interesting; since there's no one thing that universally matters,
we're all left to finding our own things that matter. and even that
gets fun, because the more things matter to us, the more we think
they should matter to other people, which naturally gets us all
upset about things that don't really matter in the first
place.<br />
<br />
so for all of the beauty, chaos, hidden order, things that don't
matter, things that do matter, the strange set of events that
brought pain, and the strange set of events that brought relief,
thanks. this is interesting. and while i haven't found everything
that matters to me, i'm not going to stop searching, creating, and
loving. i'm not here for long and nothing that i do here matters in
the long run; i have no illusions about this. but this matters to
me, and him, and her, and him, and her... and that's enough for
little ol' me.<br />

revelry, all woes forgotten, at a jolly reunion with all three
daughters and their lapdogs. never will emma rally, revived by the
sympathetic salts in flaubert's father's timely tear. whatever
evolution this or that popular character has gone through between
the book covers, his fate is fixed in our minds, and, similarly, we
expect our friends to follow this or that logical and conventional
pattern we have fixed for them. thus x will never compose the
immortal music that would clash with the second-rate symphonies he
has accustomed us to. y will never commit murder. under no
circumstances can z ever betray us. we have it all arranged in our
minds, and the less often we see a particular person the more
satisfying it is to check how obediently he conforms to our notion
of him every time we hear of him. any deviation in the fates we
have ordained would strike us as not only anomalous but unethical.

everyone wants to find out who they are and why they were born into
the world. i think it's just a little more difficult for people
like me, since society in general doesn't look favorably on us.
even among more liberal circles, we are tolerated but not accepted,
more often than not.<br />
<br />
i also think about the world, and life in general. it comes
naturally from questioning my own existance. in a lot of ways, the
world is worse off now than it has been for many years. i'm not a
doomsday advocate, but there is a certain appeal to the notion that
humanity is on the decline. all the crazy things that keep showing
up in the news...people who are only out for themselves. no one is
acting in the best interest of the public, or the world. who is
thinking ahead to the future?<br />

there was a great <em>curtis</em> comic strip i read in the sunday
comics once. the gist of it was that we should cry when babies are
born into this unfortunate world, and celebrate when people die and
go to heaven. while some would say it is macabre, i think it is
kind of true, given the current world. it made me think, at any
rate, which is more than i can say for most comics."

""a man whose conduct proceeds from good will and an acute sense of
propriety, and whose self control is equal to all emergencies; who
does not make the poor man conscious of his poverty, the obscure
man of his obscurity, or any man of his inferiority or deformity;
who is himself humbled if necessity compels him to humble another;
who does not flatter wealth, cringe before power, or boast of his
own possessions or achievements; who speaks with frankness, but
always with sympathy; who deeds follow his word; who thinks of the
rights and feelings of others, rather than his own; and who appears
well in any company; a man with whom honor is sacred and virtue is
safe.""<br />

inhabiting a persona that he's mocking but one that i relate to.
the pervasive fear of failure. the fear of wasting one's time. but
life itself is a mistake (that is, a contingency) and time exists
to be wasted and to lay you waste. so lighten up. have a less
tight-fisted relation to your life and to your time: you don't
really own either, at a certain level. your time, and your own
body, is borrowed, one might even argue, taking the long view, a
view seldom taken in harassed daily life. which is ""precisely"" my
point (do i have a point?): what would it look like to be somewhat
less possessive (to a certain extent) of our time, of our bodies,
of our lives. i am continually shocked by the inability of people,

my following say agenda and alot of future plans
""
"the society we live in. mostly about social norms involving gender
and sexuality."
"work, but outside of work i think about life in general. hmm. that
isn't a very good answer, is it? doesn't really say anything.
perhaps, 'working the system' is better.<br />
<br />
fun fact #7: a hobby of mine is to game or abuse any system i find.
credit card promos are awesome. ask me how to work it for a few
grand per year."
the next adventure
"how to incorporate my passions into my everyday life and bi-rite
ice cream sandwiches. and carrot cake."
"how people choose to spend their time.<br />
whether it is possible to be happy more often.<br />
what i should do with my energy."
"life, the future, the universe, crazy dreams, friends, family, and
when i <s>am getting off work</s> will see a paycheck again."
""
"a mix of politics (what's wrong &amp; how do we fix it) and my next
good time, whether that be a show, a music festival, a camping or
backpacking trip, or a trip abroad.<br />
<br />
my last few trips overseas were: 1) a short visit back to <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=puerto%0arico"">puerto rico</a> in april
of '09 to catch-up with friends there; 2) a two week trip to
central <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=m%c3%a9xico"">mxico</a>
in the of winter of '08/'09; and 3) a three week trip to <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=venezuela"">venezuela</a> in the winter
of '06/'07 -- with multiple spectacular car-camping and backpacking
trips in ca in between and since. although, since my purchase of a
condo in the mission in 2010, i've had to cut back a bit on the big
trips; about to round that budgetary corner soon, though! :-)"
"your mom.<br />
<br />
ok, well, i seriously don't spend a lot of time thinking.. it is
just silly to do so."
how the shit blind people find braille.
how crazy people are
""
"why so many people are caught up in the drama and chaos of the
world. but i then remember they're coming from of place of the
neurotic or wounded ego that wants to victimize themselves. ;/ so
then i have compassion and connect with that ""inner love"" inside me
and feel better. i was there once."
cherry-coloured funk
"what makes things work...why are people and things the way they
are?"
authentic assessment
how my life is changing everyday and what is to come in the future.
the moment....enjoying every moment as much as possible.
"since okcupid: why i am not answering more of the emails i receive,
why okcupid mobile app sets my status as ""online"" when i am
not.<br />
before okcupid: how to reconcile my principles with my everyday
life, will men (as in humans, but in fact mostly men) ever stop
favoring war over peace and treating their planet as a trash can,
why does the state of california award driver licenses to so many
individuals who clearly can't neither drive nor park a car."
"how to make connections between seemingly isolated people and
events, conjugating verbs, what the usa will be like in 50 years,
when human beings will mature and decide to stop wasting food,
money resources and other lives, when and where i'm getting my next
meal, what i am really meant to do with my life, how human events
can possibly be ""god's will"", how to make anagrams of stuff i see
when stuck in traffic, if i had a vanity license plate what would
it say, how i should raise my children, what's the next thing i
need to do to advance myself in life, whom can i help, being
hilarious, what's absurd in the world, how much i love dogs and
cats, when and where i'm getting my next meal, who do i know who
has a birthday this month, where the f*** is my food!?, kittens,
puppies, sunshine, saying please and thank you, thinking about how
saying please and thank you entirely out of context makes you
appear very odd. for instance, if somebody asks you for the time
and you say ""thank you"". that would be odd."
"the essence of happiness? enlightenment. i am currently on a quest
to find the keys to happiness. as i reflect on my life thus far i
see all the things that i thought would make me happy and didn't.
and so i breathe and reflect and allow myself to be present in the
moment to the truth that is in me and around me. so much to say on
this topic."
"how not to think too much.<br />
i don't like planning too far into the future, because in my
experience life is way too chaotic for that.<br />
<br />
life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans."
""
"training for a marathon it will be my first<br />
life and the future"
""
where to travel next
"mostly about work these days. i do like to expose myself to a lot
new content, whether that be music or movies or books or whatever,
so i spend a lot of time thinking of ways to get my hands on that
stuff."
"everything and anything.... depends at that moment! maybe mostly
career and life goals!"

and be disapointed with myself?"

motivations, what are they thinking about?.....something else, some
other things....."
"okay... i know it sounds cheesey but i want to keep growing as a
better person."

routine, creating a dance community center, people watching ,and
creating stories about them, writing, sexy time,s committing to my
dreams and aspirations<br />
<br />

food and talking heads"
"drag queens, fashion, the ocean, life. whether or not i remembered
my keys."
"planning fun activities for near and distant times; but, leaving
time for spontaneity. and, well, that i should exercise more often."
"life and what it means.<br />
i didn't grow up with the internet and a cell phone.<br />
my son is part of this new generation, hooked on cell phones, and
will probably connect via facebook soon.<br />
what will human beings be in 100 years from now?<br />

standard really. at the age of 12 i received my first scribe. at

"""look within and life, it seems, is very far from being 'like
this.' examine for a moment an ordinary mind on an ordinary day.
the mind receives a myriad impressions-trivial, fantastic,
evanescent, or engraved with the sharpness of steel. from all sides
they come, an incessant shower of innumerable atoms; and as they
fall, as they shape themselves into the life of monday or tuesday,
the accent falls differently from of old; the moment of importance
came not here but there; so that if a writer were a free man and
not a slave, if he could write what he chose, not what he must, if
he could base his work upon his own feeling and not upon
convention, there would be no plot, no comedy, no tragedy, no love
interest or catastrophe in the accepted style, and perhaps not a
single button sewn on as the bond street tailors would have it.
life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged; life is a
luminous halo, a semi-transparent envelope surrounding us from the
beginning of consciousness to the end. is it not the task of the
novelist to convey this varying, this unknown and uncircumscribed
spirit, whatever aberration or complexity it may display, with as
little mixture of the alien and external as possible? we are not
pleading merely for courage and sincerity; we are suggesting that
the proper stuff of fiction is a little other than custom would
have us believe it.""<br />
--virginia woolf<br />

""let us not waste our time in idle discourse! let us do something,
while we have the chance! it is not every day that we are needed.
not indeed that we personally are needed. . . to all mankind they
were addressed, those cries for help still ringing in our ears! but
at this place, at this moment of time, all mankind is us, whether
we like it or not. let us make the most of it, before it is too
late! let us represent worthily for once the foul brood to which a
cruel fate consigned us!. . . it is true that when with folded arms
we weigh the pros and cons we are no less a credit to our species.
the tiger bounds to the help of his congeners without the least
reflection, or else he slinks away into the depths of the thickets.
but that is not the question. what are we doing here, that is the
question. and we are blessed in this, that we happen to know the
answer. yes, in this immense confusion one thing alone is clear. we
are waiting for godot to come.""<br />

external stimuli. here are the snapshots if you care to know.<br />
<br />
snapshot 1. while driving, i saw an advertising banner saying ""40
years - the celebrations of the sf exploratorium."" illogically,
this triggered my thoughts on the california academy of sciences. i
then spent the next 30 minutes theorizing why i seemed to be the
only person not impressed by their exhibits. subsequently, i
debated internally whether it would make me look stupid if anyone
found out my differing opinions.<br />
<br />
snapshot 2. the common wisdom is that technology creates a new
economy, thus, new employment opportunities. to counter argue, just
for the fun of it, i overspent my brain cells calculating the
numbers to prove that the prevalence of emails not only didn't
contribute to the new economy but also diminished a sub sector of a
traditional economy. afterwards, my mind drifted into the
fantasyland of getting a phd in economics.<br />

better place than i found it, my career, my future, and all those

about that, it's food, my next travel destination (bonus point if
you love to travel too!), next book to read, weekend plans, my next
running race, figuring out new running trails in the bay area, or
how to convince my landlord to allow me to have a dog."

i usually analyze anything and everything until there is nothing
left to analyze. deconstructing any scenario, altering a
perspective either slightly or greatly, turning words and
inflections inside out and playing things backwards is what i do
with my time when i'm at work, at home, conversing or cleaning up.
thankfully, i do enough work that involves little attention so that
i can focus my thoughts on a variety of matters. one of the
benefits of such extensive contemplation is great consideration
about events and words that a lot of people give little thought to.
one the curses is that i come across as bloody nuts. i've had close
friends slant their heads and give me that questioning look as
though to say ""you gave that this much thought?"" for what its
worth, i'm not prone to trivial or superficial considerations. i
couldn't care less what wealthy celebrities do. sports is sorta fun
but beyond a few thoughts, i've got other more meaningful matters
to attend to. i focus on work related matters, my relationships,
when i'm in love i keep my partner at the forefront of my thoughts,
and i am fond of using my imagination to play music internally and
to take flight into scenarios i might never find myself in but want

technology is making people feel more isolated and disconnected

interpersonal relations, and not necessarily in a good way.
in-person conversational skills seem to be on the decline as well
as an appreciation for the care and effort required to form a
meaningful relationship with someone (for example, spending a few
minutes rather than a couple seconds to pick up the phone versus
send a text). also, is there anyone else out there that feels a bit
of sadness when so many people sitting at a bar or waiting for the

having a friendly conversation while passing the time? i can be as

that the what 'i'm looking for' questions are generalizations, and
are not 'sure things'.<br />
<br />
the many behavioral choices we make, and our motivations... for
ex., this speech i heard from a woman; ""whenever i'm in a
confrontation, i make sure to never say or do anything 'wrong' so
that no one can ever point their finger at me and blame me for
anything.""<br />
one would hope that good behavior be motivated by compassion
tempered with empathy towards our fellow man, rather than an agenda
to maintain one's circumferential virtue...<br />
<br />
the use of the words: never, always, nothing, everything, anything,
everyone, no one, everywhere, nowhere and totally. and the two
words together as in, 'life' -fill in the blank- i.e. ''life
sucks''. life is a big word... and i think about these words a
little more, in the context of hearing someone say something such
as, ""i want a woman who 'never' takes 'life' seriously.'' i find
that these words are rarely the truth once questioned, and can make
for extreme, and unwarranted seriousness, i.e. emotional
burden.<br />
can you feel the contradiction there, in looking for someone who
""'never' takes 'life' seriously."" ? ha!<br />

food to be just as good as, if not better than, sex, and those who
laugh at that notion. while i certainly enjoy sex, i could see

utilities, taxes, and setting aside savings, most people usually
have one or two passions they like to blow their money on: clothes,
a pet, a boat, a coke habit, whatever. i spend almost all of it on
food and drink. if you are also that kind of person, get in touch.

extremely rare and will run out before oil does, and a hydrogen

enforcement occasionally getting after it, but once we run out of

if you really were such grandmasters in sarcasm you wouldn't state

usually stop reading your profile when you begin bragging about
your sarcasm skills - though if you happen to be ridiculously hot
and express a predilection for fellatio i might make an exception

"1)restaurant names that entertain. 'godawful falafel' is in a tight

2)blinkers, you know, turn signals. pedestrian deaths continue to
place san francisco as the deadliest city per capita, yet we have
an under-utilized safety device that's been in cars for 50 years.
the turn signal is a feature that's so simple to use the driver
doesn't even have to look at it to use it. it gives life-saving
information to the pedestrian about which way a multi-ton vehicle
will go, yet strangely police ignore it. cite the scofflaws;
enforcement helps not only pedestrians but other drivers too.
consider how many times you have been sitting in traffic and
finally when the light turns green, the inconsiderate driver in
front of you then decides to turn left, stops, and there you are
stuck behind him, wasting gas and patience until he turns... using
turn signals is not ""giving information to the enemy"", as columnist
rob morse once quipped, but provide non-verbal communication to
help us avoid injuries and death. good road manners lessen tempers
too.<br />
so signal turns before you turn, and as the wise driving teacher
said, ""aim far in steering; see the big picture"". and please, look
for people before cars! look left, right, and quickly left again.
this is critical at intersections where peds are most likely to
cross. don't be a stinker, use your blinker!"

""you have to trust in something--your gut, destiny, life, karma,
whatever--because believing that the dots will connect down the
road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when
it leads you off the well-worn path, and that will make all the
difference.""<br />
<br />
""remembering that i'll be dead soon is the most important thing
i've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life,
because almost everything--all external expectations, all pride,
all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away
in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
remembering that you are going to die is the best way i know to
avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. you are
already naked. there is no reason not to follow your heart.""<br />
<br />
""your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's
life. don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results
of other people's thinking. don't let the noise of others' opinions
drown out your own inner voice, heart and intuition. they somehow
already know what you truly want to become. everything else is
secondary.""<br />

additional reading for the chronically bored:<br />
<br />
the problem with studying the brain is that the more i study the
more i think i know how i work: why i do the things i do and why i
feel the way i do. the reason it's a problem is i really still have
no idea why and now i'm just attaching rationale to observation to
fit my current perspective on the function of the brain,
generalizing more than explaining, conforming more than
comforting.<br />
<br />
i spend a lot of time thinking about why things are the way they
are. i'm a firm believer in natural selection (i feel a little
funny saying 'believe', since saying you 'believe' in natural
selection is like saying you 'believe' in logic. you know?). eg:
eyebrows. they seem so useless. decorative. yet everyone has them.
at some crucial point in human evolution, when our ancestors
started to shed their fir on a genetic level, it stands to reason
that eyebrows were left on the brow perhaps to shield the eyes from

talks to others, let my love for her build within me,<br />
as she creates beauty around her, then, i would enjoy<br />
the beauty she creates and count my blessings. i would<br />
hand her things that she asks for, or ask her to hand<br />
things to me as we build our lives together. i would<br />
know that in fifty years, we will be together, and<br />
love every second of our future and every second of<br />
our past with each other. i would tell her jokes, some<br />
great, sometimes lame, kid, tease her in the grocery<br />

many guys. therefore, i'm not having as much sex as i would like,

i found myself at applebee's and was torn between the tomato basil,

clam chowder, but a little voice inside me was saying that since
clam chowder is always the soup of the day on fridays, this
particular chowder must have been sitting in the pot for two days

<br />
i think the best thing for you to do is just live your life. live a
life that's worth living, one where you do what you want to do,
pursue your passions. that way, if you meet someone, they'll be
joining a life that's already really good. and if you don't meet
anyone, you can still look back at the end and say, ""you know what:
i lived a really great life.""<br />

here are some possibilities:<br />
1.) love. i'm open to feeling and expressing love if we're highly
compatible intellectually, emotionally and sexually. (i've already
got a primary partner, so if i were to embark in this direction
with someone, the relationship would never include
cohabitation.)<br />
2.) friendship and sex. much like the above, but neither of us
feels inspired to use the l-word.<br />
3.) fuck-buddies. we respect each other; we like each other well
enough to spend two or three hours together getting our rocks off
(once a week?/month?/year? -- it all depends...). i can have this
kind of relationship pretty easily. it does require great sexual
chemistry and zero drama.<br />

plastered, but i dislike/suck at taking self portraits and rarely
sit still for photos. ya just gotta trust me...if you think my
photos here look good, you will be pleasantly surprised when you
meet me.<br />
<br />
why 90% of the profiles look exactly the same....same text...same
pics....if you get a message stating that i rated your profile 4-5
stars, it may be simply due to the fact that you are part of the
other ten percent and i greatly respect that you are willing to try
something different and made a unique profile instead of posting a
collection of vacation photos and shots of you running a marathon.

""the world is like a ride at an amusement park, and when you choose
to go on it, you think it's real, because that's how powerful our
minds are. and the ride goes up and down and round and round and it
has thrills and chills and it's very brightly colored and it's very
loud. and it's fun, for a while.<br />
<br />
some people have been on the ride for a long time, and they begin
to question: 'is this real? or is this just a ride?' and other
people have remembered, and they come back to us and they say 'hey!
don't worry, don't be afraid - ever - because... this is just a
ride.' and we kill those people.<br />
<br />
'shut him up! we have a lot invested in this ride! shut him up!
look at my furrows of worry; look at my big bank account, and my
family. this has to be real.'<br />
<br />
it's just a ride. but we always kill those good guys who try and
tell us that - ever notice that? - and we let the demons run amok.
but it doesn't matter, because... it's just a ride, and we can
change it any time we want. it's only a choice. no effort. no
worry. no job. no savings and money. just a choice, right now,
between fear and love. the eyes of fear want you to put bigger
locks on your door, buy bigger guns, close yourself off. the eyes
of love, instead, see all of us as one.<br />
<br />
here's what we can do to change the world, right now, into a better
ride. take all that money we spend on weapons and defense each year
and, instead, spend it feeding, clothing and educating the poor of
the world, which it would do many times over - not one human being
excluded - and we can explore space together, both inner and outer,
forever. in peace."" -bill hicks"

"wait, what? your profile says you're funny, witty and intelligent!
whoa, i happen to be the same way! amazing. i think we're meant for
each other. what's the measurement of funny? i mean, isn't everyone
hit or miss, depending on the group? i'll forgive you if you're
hot. can we make out now? i really want to grab your penis. that's
all. i've been staring at your crotch all night. i just want to see
how big it is. maybe put my face in it. can i poke it with my
finger? will it do magical things? no, not really? wait, really?
what? oh yeah, #awkward.<br />
<br />
i think it's funny when people write, ""you have to be in shape.""
well, this kind of thinking is weird to me because technically,
everyone is in a sort of shape, aren't they? it's like the word
a/c. people use it as a term to make your room colder, when it just
means conditioning the air. isn't heating your room a sort of
conditioning, too? or do i have that all wrong?<br />

oh there are so many attractive guys on the muni in the mornings.
how i wish i had the courage to say hello. all i can do is smile

guys. are the only attractive guys out here gay? or are they just
not single. actually, they probably don't need okc. well played.
yes. i have conversations with myself.<br />

as i'm buckling my belt on any plane, i like to look at the size of
the seat belt of the person that sat there before me. the stories
that came with the person. holy ass, this person was obese. did
they pass gas on this chair? perhaps they got their sticky fingers
all over the buttons. then a wave of panic washes over me as ocd
hits me.<br />

why is it okay to bring dogs to the grocery store? i mean, it can't
be very sanitary. 'yes, i just walked my dog and picked up his crap

that's why you wash your fruits and veggies when you get

"tons of stuff, i'm a philosopher/scientist/inventor by nature so i
think about pretty much anything and everything.<br />
<br />
<strong>specifically:</strong><br />
how can i efficiently simulate our universe? more generally, is
there a smallest set of rules/conditions that can produce
substantial emergent complexity? is it possible to control that
complexity in meaningful ways?<br />
<br />
what's the best way to teach critical thinking skills to kids? to
adults? is it possible to teach creativity?<br />
<br />
can i create intelligence in a silicon medium? what is
intelligence? what forms does it take? is intelligence nature or
nurture and can it be enhanced?<br />
<br />
do schools negatively impact a child's ability to think for
themselves, to be creative, analytical? is it possible for a
majority of students to complete a standard education and have
strong critical thinking and problem solving skills? is it social
and political pressure that causes a majority of americans to be
mostly regurgitative in their thought processes, or is it an innate
quality of humanity?<br />
<br />
will the square peg fit in the round hole?<br />
<br />
will nano-robotics be mature enough to essentially allow for
immortality before i die? if i die first, will there be a way to
bring me back? will anyone want to?<br />
<br />
who am i? how much of me could you remove while still retaining my
identity? what is identity? since many of our cells replace
themselves, how many times have i died already? if i could
instantly replicate myself as a perfect copy, would that copy
instantly become someone else, or would it be necessary for us to
experience a different external event before we diverged? this may
seem ridiculous, but consider the upcoming technical achievement of
uploading your consciousness to a silicon medium; did you die in
transition? how much of this is completely arbitrary?<br />
<br />
does right and wrong exist? is morality simply a social construct?
assuming right/wrong does not exist; when is it better for you
personally to break societal rules? when is it better for your
group? is it possible to raise a child on the belief that good/bad
do not exist, while simultaneously teaching them to be selfless and
compassionate?<br />
<br />
where did i put my keys? why can i remember esoteric details about
programming languages, but not where i put my damn keys?<br />
<br />
while i'd be sad to see the world as we know it disappear, does it
really matter that humans are radically changing the earth? mother
nature has, at numerous times in the past, caused massive
extinction events, the earth has seen drastic temperature changes
and the composition of chemicals in the atmosphere has hardly
remained constant; is it a bad thing that we are changing the
earth? on that note: what is the difference between natural and
man-made? are we not a product of nature? therefore shouldn't
everything we do be a product of nature?<br />
<br />
why many animals will defend their newborn babies with their life.
i mean, i would do it too, but it doesn't make much sense. in the
event the parent dies, it is likely that the newborn will also die,
as it can't care for itself. wouldn't it be better to let the baby
go and just make more? how did this trait evolve? and why is it so
pervasive in mammals?<br />
<br />
is that an antelope driving a car? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljp1dphowps"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">nope,
chuck testa</a>.<br />
<br />
does the uncertainty principal really destroy the notion of a cause
and effect based reality? is it possible to compute the outcome of
everything, or is the universe we live in really random? and what's
up with this spooky action at a distance stuff in modern particle
physics? that stuff blows my mind.<br />
<br />
is the propensity to ""believe"" inherent in humans, or is it a
by-product of societal pressures? if religion were to disappear
tomorrow would the majority of people still have a belief system
based on blind indoctrination? though we are inherently a pack
animal, is it possible to make more people into leaders and
independent thinkers?<br />
<br />
what percentage of the food in my refrigerator will i have to throw
away because i got side-tracked by any one of these topics and
burned it to a crisp?<br />
<br />
will lisp/scheme ever become a mainstream programming language?
will i ever work on a commercial product using a lisp dialect? how
long before i never have to hear about java again?<br />
<br />
sexism, racism and prejudice in general suck; but how long before
people realize that we weren't all created equal? that we didn't
all have the same life experiences? that not everyone thinks the
same way as you do (no matter how much you want that to be true)?
that not everyone values the same things that you value?<br />
<br />
old people that cross the street without looking: how are they
still alive?<br />
<br />
how many conversations on politics will i have until the next
conversation that does not mention a single politician? seriously
people, i can discuss just about any topic in politics, but i have
to stop and think for a moment to figure out the vice president's
name, and anything below that is just not possible. the people of
politics (when they're not corrupt) are completely
uninteresting.<br />
<br />
how long before robotics and software reduce the available jobs to
less than 10% of the number of people? 1%? what will society look
like in the aftermath? how many countries and governments will
topple as we transition?<br />
<br />
how much longer will i ramble on here?<br />
<br />
is there an equation to determine the number of successful
solutions to any problem given only the parameters? does p=np? will
anyone ever solve the halting problem? is it possible to prove the
correctness of a non-trivial program in a small enough amount of
time to make it a feasible alternative to the current development
methodologies?<br />
<br />
if i replace all my bones with carbon nanotube equivalents, what is
the tallest building that i could jump off of without causing
myself trauma? if i replace my teeth with k-9's to make eating
steak with my hands both easier and more fun, will i bite my tongue
off? in the dawning age of cybernetics, will i take the plunge and
become part machine for the obvious advantages it will give me over
my fellow man; or will my fear of being hacked stop me?<br />
<br />
how intelligent are other species of animals? do any surpass the
intelligence of humans? is tool use predominately spurred by the
opposable thumb? what is the smallest creature that can exhibit
traits of intelligence?<br />
<br />
why the current trend is to focus on diet for weight loss, when
exercise is clearly the better choice? when i'm craving some food
product, is it because there is something in that product that my
body needs, or is it purely neurological?<br />
<br />
is aquaponics a viable alternative to traditional farming
techniques? can it be successfully scaled up in an indoor growing
environment? at what point will the rise in population outpace even
the most exotic methods of food production?<br />
<br />
will the first world of today be the third world of 100 years from
now? will overpopulation spur us to colonize space, or will it be a
lack of natural resources? will we even make it there? at what
point will the human race become extinct? will we see the end of
the universe?<br />
<br />
seriously. when am i going to stop this and get back to work?<br />
<br />
what's the most promising energy technology of the next 10 years?
what about the next 100? will we ever produce cold fusion? can we
cut the hazardous by products and risk of fission to make it a
cheap and sustainable energy solution? when will we be able to
produce large quantities of anti-matter and store it
efficiently?<br />
<br />
is the space elevator going to be produced in my lifetime? will i
be able to book a reservation on a space station in the next 50
years? how will we deal with muscle atrophy for long duration space
flights? will we come up with artificial gravity, or will we travel
in giant spinning hulls?<br />
<br />
will linux ever replace microsoft on the desktop? will mac ever
step outside the bdsm club? will the courts ever do something that
incidentally destroys open source software?<br />
<br />
will we ever have real patent reform? when will the bureaucrats
realize that software is not patentable?<br />
<br />
what will be the next major step in human evolution? will humans
dictate their own evolution from now on? will human genetic
experimentation become socially acceptable? how long after will
there be a market for designer babies?<br />
<br />
will society as a whole ever move away from hero worship? is the
deification of media stars temporary? will scientists ever attain
the kind of cult status that current day celebrities have?<br />
<br />
will anyone read this far?<br />
<br />
will it ever become widely respected that baby language is harmful
to the development of your child? similarly will it ever become
widely known that negative reinforcement only serves to encourage
bad behavior? why can't responsible parents have more children than
the irresponsible ones?<br />
<br />
is it possible to have a capitalistic society where wealth is not
the primary goal? will our society place more or less emphasis on
consumerism as time passes?<br />
<br />
why is it that almost everyone who mentions grammar in their
profile cannot capitalize the first word of each sentence? why do
people consider it important that i also think the earth is bigger
than the sun? though i cringe at being marked down for being right,
am i better off for it?<br />
<br />
why am i getting pulled over for speeding when there are so many
other problems that deserve police attention?<br />
<br />
if yellowstone erupted, would i be prepared? how would i deal with
the coming apocalypse?<br />
<br />
if i was trapped on a desert island with one other person and no
food; how long would i wait before killing and eating them? would i
wait until i absolutely had no choice, or would i do it sooner out
of fear that they will kill me first? which, i guess, then begs the
question; how would i preserve the meat?<br />
<br />
if i fell out of a tree, would i try to land on my legs and save
myself, or would i just put my head down and be done with it?<br />
<br />
if i came down with an incurable, debilitating and painful disease;
how would i kill myself? if it happened to a friend, would i be
able to kill them? even if there weren't any consequences?<br />
<br />
if i could give birth to a child would i want to? is it okay to
grow my baby in a tank? if i had to choose between a child who was
physically crippled but incredibly intelligent or the inverse, what
would i pick? is it better to abort a child that will assuredly be
severely crippled?<br />
<br />
will there ever be a day when i never hear another argumentum ad
populum? ad hominem? will pascal's wager ever fade away as the
absurd argument that it is? will the majority of people ever stop
using post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning for complex events?<br />

energy into a laser beam of creativity."
everything

"whether i'm making the best decision, or doing something to the
best of my ability, but this doesn't always feel like a good use of
my time, so i'm also training myself to stop thinking so much."

cooking and hanging out with my friends
"these days? about what comes next, the big project on the horizon,
who i can convince to go surfing someplace warm with me, and who
i'll be sharing the adventure with."
"art, music, film, beauty in the mundane. how to evolve, how people
relate. the way the sky looks at sunset or how the beauty of the
simple things can mean the most"
""
trying not to think. i get so sick of the constant mind chatters.
everything i just listed
how to enjoy my life to the fullest
""
"random things that happen around me. where i am going to be in five
years. hypothetical situations. if i were a superhero what would my
powers be. and, how other people answer questions like this"

crossroads. i enjoy thinking about where i may be headed."
"current events, technology, travel, music, etc."
when my next day off is and what i'm going to do with it.
"do my neighbors like me? why does their dog always bark at me? does
their dog like me?<br />
<br />
what i want out of life. what i'm going to be doing on the weekend.
whether or not i locked my car. new recipes to test. should i walk
or should i take muni? where i would like to travel next. i've been
to australia, new zealand, taiwan, france, england, the
netherlands, switzerland, italy, costa rica, austria, the czech
republic, hungary and slovakia in the last 3 years. nicknames. i
love nicknames (giving and receiving). some call me nay nay, some
call me wonger, some just call me sexy."
how life is good to me.
""
""
"whether or not i'm thinking about the types of things i should be
thinking about...."
what the future holds..
"- how the most beautiful things are fractal in nature.<br />
- how randomness and chaos permeate life.<br />
- how selling yourself online is now a desired characteristic in
these days of craigslists and okcupids. i know i'm a wonderful
person, a great housemate and a catch, why should i have to be good
at convincing you of it?"
"how to save the world and where my next trip will take me. ideally
i would like to combine the two and travel to 3rd world countries
making a positive impact. i believe we should all try to leave the
world a little better place than the way we found it."
"how this country got itself into such poor shape. we are broke as a
country and as individuals, we don't make anything of
self-sustaining value for ourselves or the rest of the world, we
live in a disposable society with one hand on a credit card and the
other on a trash compactor."
"the ordinary moments that make up life, sometimes i worry about
things that take care of themselves, but i am working on that."
""
my family my future
"my career and where i can go with it. however rescently i have been
equally focused on starting a meaningful relationship with someone
who i know i would have a fun time with"
"how to do the next thing i do better than the last thing i did. and
that applies to everything. i'm often asked to do performances at
clubs or galleries or shoot modeling photographs, so i am usually
kicking around original scenarios for stage shows or photo shoots."
"i think a lot about how the universe always seems to balance out
the bad shit it throws my way with some really good shit. i keep
experiencing examples of this."
"sex. this coming summer, as well as what is to come next year.
transitioning from living on campus to normal life will be
enjoyable, but probably different than i expect. but mostly i think
about when i'm going to get my next chance to get a break and where
i'm going to hike when i do."
orange. the color.
what to do next. my mind shifts gears a lot.

i'm myself in ten years, which is kind of scary to think of at 22."

what i will get into in the upcoming weekend.
"psychology. art. design. taxonomy. anatomy. sport climbing. jumping
into rivers. waste disposal. food."
"sometimes i like to think about feeling, and sometimes i like to
see how i feel about my thinking, and sometimes i just breathe in
and out and attend to my momentary experience."
"i spend a lot of time trying to solve problems at work for other
people so i suspect 40 hours at the minimum is spent thinking about
that.<br />
<br />
i spend a lot of time figuring where i want to travel to and how to
get there. what shows i want to go to. how to be a good
friend/daughter/lover/etc. do i want to take up drums and start up
a girl garage band. where can i find that album i've been searching
high and low for. in other words, lots of random thoughts."
all kinds of things...
how to build stuff better.
why am i thinking so much...doing is much more fun adn productive
what to write in my profile. . .just kidding.
"boys, my family, new countries to visit, and more boys!"
"what's next move job-wise, what can i do to improve myself, when am
i going to start on that youtube singing vlog, what do i need to

"evolution, the future of mankind, where my socks go when i do
laundry."

"reification, not in a dumb chilling spiritual way."
the universe/astronomy.
usually i'm thinking about places i'd like to travel to.

yet so hard to find a true connection."

"social inequities and the very wonderful (f%ed up) state of the

i can relate pretty well to the ideas in this quote:<br />
<br />
""it is vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with
tranquility; they must have action; and they will make it if they
cannot find it...nobody knows how many rebellions, besides
political rebellions, ferment in the masses of life which people

"i don't love introspection. i prefer to think about other people
and why they do what they do.<br />

i enjoy thinking about the quirks of san francisco and its
inhabitants. where is that couple going dressed entirely in
feathers on a sunday afternoon? how do people find these kinds of
activities? who left the rotary telephone on the fire hydrant
outside my apartment, and why?"
where i'm moving to next.
things in a larry david kind of way
"music, traveling, my friends and family (my sister is my best
friend, talk to her about 4 times a week especially right now cause
she is knocked up...i'm gonna be an uncle!!! :)<br />
oh and when is my next vacation....electric forest music festival
in michigan at the end of june if you were wondering!"
"how i'm gonna take over the world and when i'm gonna actually meet
you!"
"what on earth to write here... gosh... still thinking. ok, will
come back and think a bit more about this tomorrow."
either something deeply profound or profoundly stupid.
falling in love again...
buffalo wings and simpsons quotes.
"in a room sit three great men, a king, a priest, and a rich man
with his gold. between them stands a sellsword, a little man of
common birth and no great mind. each of the great ones bids him
slay the other two. 'do it,' says the king, 'for i am your lawful
ruler.' 'do it,' says the priest, 'for i command you in the name of
the gods.' 'do it,' says the rich man, 'and all this gold shall be
yours.' so who lives and who dies?"

just saw my computer screen."
"i think about so many things at any give moment, usually about
trying new things. been interested in enrichment classes - why not
take a wood working class or introduction to letterpress? i think
about getting out of town and traveling. been also thinking about
when i am going to have time to sew the cushion seat for the bay
window in my apartment."

"i wouldn't say i obsess much about any one thing in particular. at
least i try not to. depends on where i am and what i'm doing.
recently i've been thinking a lot about a personal travel
adventure. skiing in japan is high on the list, well japan in
general...now i guess i should starting thinking about saving $$. i
also think alot about how i can help. how i can do something to
better the world, but that also overwhelms me and then i starting
thinking about other stuff. starting on wednesdays i spend a lot of
time thinking about what's in store for the weekend. until now,
i've spent some quality time thinking (and procrastinating) about
finally filling out this profile."

capable of such things), but i find my job interesting, so i think
about what i can do, and what i need to learn.<br />
<br />
on the learning front, i'm always up for learning something new.
i'll blast through a new web framework in a weekend, and find
something to use it for in the next week. i'm full of ideas, but
generally i don't tend to implement them. the computer world is
still rapidly changing, and i feel the compulsion to keep up."

geopolitical scene, and sex..."

"my life. where i'm going, how i got here, and how to make the most
of the time i have. life is full of ups and downs. something
insignificant today can change your world the next day. we all make
mistakes, but it's what you do when times are challenging that is a

world will be so much better if people can just be more accepting
of each other's differences."

my career and how to live a happy life.

exactly an ""activity partner"" is if it's not a friend or someone to
date."

definitely need something to look forward to."
"why do cats ignore cars, are they trying to be cool or do they not
realize they are moments from death? is smurfette a boy smurf in
drag?<br />
i'm also thinking about how we live in a plutocracy but everyone
calls it democracy. the education system is manipulated by the
elite to keep poor people in poverty. social mobility is stagnant
and we are blinded by consumerism. how globalization is only
beneficial to 1% of americans. why being a good capitalist and
depleting earth's resources are like peanut butter and jelly; they
are dependant on each other. why western culture is in its last
dying breath. how europe will be an islamic continent in 50 yrs.
why history varies depending on which side you're looking at it
from. also how corporations and money are just man made constructs
that have no inherent value. why humans are collapsing the earth's
ecosystems."
"what i want to do with my free time, i've been thinking a lot about
surfing. my thoughts will soon be shifting to skiing. what i'd do

move to next. who knows you could be my traveling partner. i am
always thinking about food and bikes."

world...that's only because i already figured out how they get
ships in a bottle."
what i should be doing other than thinking
"why a team with some of the best pitching in baseball has very
little offense (and why half my boys are on the dl at any given
time). why the city doesn't have l.a's weather and why i have to
wear a jacket in july as a result. why my csa box comes with
awesome produce with the exception of the lettuce which always has
issues."

"string theory, architectures, paleo-zoology, the oceans, what i'm
gonna make my next piece of furniture out of, visiting friends in
france, finding a new scuba partner, getting laid, the middle east
in flux, the war(s). the impending collapse of the petro economy.
how we got where we are (it's something called 'history' and if
people paid more attention to it, we might stop making the same
stupid mistakes over and over and over and...). stringing words
into sentences, sentences into paragraphs, paragraphs into
chapters, and so on. simplifying my life a bit more. getting rid of
baggage (too much of it works like an anchor). wondering how
valentino rossi is going to do on the ducati motogp bike this
year.<br />
the list goes on and on and on..."
how to keep living a meaningful life.
everything...
the last place i put my keys.
"what to write in my ok cupid profile that will attract kind and
understanding mates."
"what should i make today?!<br />
<br />
what will inspire me today to help me see some piece of the world a
bit differently?<br />
<br />
do i need to travel to experience a big epiphany, or is it more
about the experiences i have everyday?"
"lyrics to songs i don't entirely remember. things i've learned that
i don't entirely remember. ways to simultaneously progress and
regress."
everything and nothing.
"business, philosophy, global culture, how to really make something

worrying-wondering about."
"astronomy. i mean, i am far from an astrophysics whiz but i
undestand the conceptual and logic aspects of it very well and find
it overwhelmingly fascinating. my mind wanders to thoughts of
hypernovae or pulsars<br />
<br />
places. okay, this one is really weird. i have a frequent tendancy
to obsess over the details of an extremely specific area of space.
if i space out, it is very likely due to the fact that i'm building
a hypothetical history of the people/objects/events that existed in
the 100 square foot living room i'm sitting in going back to when
it was a 100 square foot patch of prehistoric forest. sometimes the
fact that i do this worries me."
"in no order - my work, my dog, my friends, my family. i think about
the value of things - what we do, who we affect, what makes
everything ""worth it"".<br />
<br />
i spend a lot of time trying to land my feet right inside the tiles
whenever i'm walking over them. i guess i never got over that as a
kid."
"i guess i'll take this question a little more seriously.<br />
<br />
i spend a lot of time thinking about where i want to be, and i'm
referring to different aspects in my life. i think about where i
want to be in my career (and where i am now), and what i need to do
get there. about how to physically improve my health and strengthen
my body, and get closer to my workout goals. about my friends. the
ones i keep in touch with all the time, and the other ones who i
should be contacting more often. about where i want to travel, may
it be big or small, i usually have something lined up but it's
always fun to plan ahead and think about crossing another
event/country/visit off the bucket list.<br />
<br />
i spend a lot of time thinking about what i'm not doing, what i
should be doing to improve upon that, and then how far i've come
(if that haha).<br />
<br />
i'm constantly a work-in-progress, but hey it's all about moving
forward, even if it means taking a step back first."

be such a bad thing since i am always cold."

i don't believe in an afterlife, so i don't have to spend my whole
life fearing hell, or fearing heaven even more. for whatever the
tortures of hell, i think the boredom of heaven would be even
worse.  isaac asimov<br />

the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to
live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the
same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but
burn, burn, burn, like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like
spiders across the stars, and in the middle, you see the blue
center-light pop, and everybody goes ahh...  jack kerouac<br />

some men see things and ask why? i dream things and ask why not?

here's to the crazy ones. the misfits. the rebels. the
troublemakers. the round pegs in the square holes. the ones who see
things differently. they're not fond of rules. and they have no
respect for the status quo. you can quote them, disagree with them,
glorify or vilify them. about the only thing you can't do is ignore
them. because they change things. they push the human race forward.
and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.
because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change
the world, are the ones who do.  apple<br />

how vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to
live.<br />
i wish to suggest that a man may be very industrious, and yet not
spend his time well. there is no more fatal blunderer than he who
consumes the greater part of his life getting his living. all great
enterprises are self-supporting. the poet, for instance, must
sustain his body by his poetry, as a steam planing-mill feeds its
boilers with the shavings it makes. you must get your living by
loving.  henry david thoreau<br />
<br />
borders: i have never seen one. but i have heard they exist in the
minds of some people.  thor heyerdahl<br />
<br />
the law changes and i don't. how i stand vis--vis the law at any
given moment depends on the law. the law can change from state to
state, from nation to nation, from city to city. i guess i have to
go by a higher law. how's that? yeah, i consider myself a road man
for the lords of karma.  hunter s. thompson<br />
<br />
your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
don't be trapped by dogma  which is living with the results of
other people's thinking. don't let the noise of others' opinions
drown out your own inner voice. and most important, have the
courage to follow your heart and intuition. they somehow already
know what you truly want to become. everything else is
secondary.<br />
<br />
the only way to do great work is to love what you do. if you

dr. drew. and believe me i was a big dr. drew fan i mean i feel
like a lot of us grew up on loveline... i could even handle the
celebrity rehab series by looking beyond the circus and realizing
that maybe if one person got help by watching the show; then that
couldn't possibly be bad, right? but then the whole casey anthony
fiasco happened and boom!!! dr. drew seemed to become just another
talking head... speculating about what could possibly be going on
in the head of a very sick young lady. meanwhile two of his former
""patients"" die while he's preaching his gospel on hln about whether
or not the anthony family will reunite or not. honestly, no one can
no that, not at this early of a date; it's all speculation. and
frankly that's what made me like the old dr. drew, he was straight
to the facts all the time... a nerd but a cool nerd if you feel me
on that. and when someone called in to loveline with a problem he
wouldn't speculate about what might be going on with them; he use
his medical experience to help the person solve their problems,
usually by telling them something that they didn't exactly want to
hear. that's what made me love dr. drew, no matter what he was
going to try to help you, no matter how awkward it made radio and
then t.v. : the producers be damned dr. drew would sacrifice a
segment to help out a young kid who had a mild case of the clap. it
didn't always make for great theatre but his heart was always in
the right place. then celebrity rehab came out and even though i
still loved the good doc... i felt weird about him parading around
these pseudo-celebs like they were animals in a circus. and let's
be honest with ourselves; two weeks with amy fisher, and the cow
steroid guy, being constantly followed by cameras is hardly an
ideal situation to get sober. but still i gave dr. drew the benefit
of the doubt cause someone watching might realize they have a
problem and get help themselves because of the show, no matter how
perverse it may seem to the casual viewer. now, with his one hour
hln show... i don't know who the hell this guy is anymore. he was
quoted as saying ""when she cries it's all an act"" i'm no casey
anthony apologist but again he's speculating away... he's making a
career on speculating. and who is he helping now, well he's
catering to the people obsessed with the outcome of this trial and
he's turning them into a lynch mob. dr. drew, from someone who
feels like you could be my uncle or something... stick to what your
good at. medical facts about teenagers with herpes... leave the
speculating to nancy grace, she never had a reputation to lose
anyway."

on okcupid, i particularly think about the intersection of computer
science and love. mathematicians have been trying to crack dating
for a long time, but they've been embarrassed to come out and say
it, so they talk about ""stable matching in bipartite graphs"" (how
to pair everyone up so that no two people prefer one another to the
people they're already dating) or ""the secretary problem"" (how many
people to date before deciding to marry).<br />
<br />
even without jargon you encounter some neat stuff, like the
<a href=""http://www.laboratorium.net/archives/thestatisticsoflove.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">statistics of love</a> which is a parable about how
something simple like matching people based on their answers to
questions is actually quite difficult. surprisingly, who you want
to meet doesn't have any bearing on who you should be matched with,

my life philosophy: when i was a kid, i tended to be a little more
of a thinking kid, trying to figure out what i wanted to do with my
life, the meaning of life, why different cultures have different
attitudes towards race, school, etc., and a lot more. nowadays,
i've simplified and silo my life into completely separate spheres-
family/friends/people i deeply care about, work/career, a few core
career/personal interests, and everything (prioritized in that
order). i kind of realized at some point in high school that life
is short, and i wanted to do things in my career/life that would
make the lives of the next generation better. this meant that i
needed to focus and simplify my life, and that's what led to the
silo-ing. so outwardly, i may sound completely articulate and seem
to have very particular interests, but the ""thinking kid"" in me is
still there, it's just silo-ed into the ""everything"" category! hope

sniffed at him from above. trembling, the man looked down to where,

sustained him.<br />

for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk,
mad to be saved, delirious of everything at the same time, the ones
who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn
like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across
the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and
everybody goes 'awwww!'"" or leonard cohen: ""i heard of a man who
says words so beautifully, that if he only speaks their name, women
give themselves to him. if i am dumb beside your body while silence
blossoms like tumors on our lips, it is because i hear a man climb
the stairs and clear his throat outside our door....""</p>"

"let's say that you were sedated, open brain surgery was performed,
and your brain was removed and placed into another different human
body. somehow, they got it to work. you would wake up with this
other human body and still be conscious and completely yourself,
save the physical differences, right? disregarding existence of a
soul.<br />
<br />
now, let's say that you are sedated, and your brain is copied
exactly, down to every last atom. this would, i assume, make an
exact working copy of your brain. now, place this brain into
another persons body. then both people are revived....as soon as
you both became conscious, you would mentally be two different
people (although very similar) because you would be immediately
experiencing different things. again, besides the physical
differences. now, until you are both conscious enough to experience
new stimuli, are you both the same person? leading into the final
situation...<br />
<br />
let's say that your brain is copied, like described above, while
you are sedated. then, the brain is implanted into another body.
then, the original you is completely destroyed, and the ""copy"" of
you is revived. is this copy then you? would you wake up and see
through the eyes of the copy, or would you never wake up again? it
doesn't seem like you would wake up and simply be the copy, but how
would an exact copy be any different from the original itself, as
long as the original wasn't changing to differ it from the copy? if
the original is destroyed, then the copy cannot differ from it..so
how is this situation different from the first, where we simply
transplant the brain?"

guilty being me/middle class/american and what not. most americans
and many others elsewhere in the world are living a life of
materialism with a lot of hedonism mixed in.(myself definitely
included) we are stuck in this world of capitalism, we are a
product of that system. is this a good thing? it is a complicated
situation. people are starving, people are dying. there is disease,
and there is war. our planet and nearly all its inhabitants are
hurting. but, do we care? should we care? care more than about
getting the new iphone or ipad, or missing the concert/party. these
thoughts can be bothersome. especially if you carry the weight of

question the values of yourself within this system. all of that

"first: circuits. i have a very close, personal relationship with
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=electrons"">electrons</a> and i
spend a great deal of time thinking about how next i plan on
getting them to do my bidding. i mean, that doesn't make me a total
math nerd that only thinks about math, i honestly think about other
things too.<br />
<br />
for instance, <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=music"">music</a>.
a lot of the circuits i think about actually have to do with music,
so this is really kind of cheating. incidentally, there's typically
a soundtrack of some sort playing in my head. i was made fun of
once for this when i was fourteen, but that grocery store manager
can eat a bag of dicks.<br />

after music: these things aren't as important as circuits and
music, and so get to share a single comma-delimited list. they are

feel that it's nearly perfect, if you think otherwise, message me)."

- find work in the area/cause which you enjoy and believe in. after

try to work so you can do stuff you like outside work is not going
to work :)<br />
<br />
- obviously find a partner who loves you for who you are and
viceversa<br />
<br />
- always live with in your means - seems very simple but very
important. it doesn't matter how much you earn or wealth you
acquire if you frequently aspire or live outside your means you
will never be happy and bound to be miserable eventually.<br />

"so many people on these personals really think writing all these
detailed descriptions about themselves is going to provide an
accurate representation of them in real-life. like, i could write;
""really smart"", or ""really fun to be around"", and get other people
believing these to be true - which is even crazier. and ""smart"" can
mean so many different things to so many people that it's pointless
to even mention: it's all relative. why even fill out a
""dating-personna""? i could be delusional, lying to myself, or judge
myself on what others in my peer group see me as. and still people
write overly complimentary profiles, on most occasion, to make
themselves feel better. i find myself rummaging through profiles
like i'm looking for a lost treasure at my local salvation army
thrift store. every item in the store looks just as rudimentary as
the one next to it. there is a proven theory that suggests people
tend to follow the crowd rather than go against it. this is so that
their outcome is averaged-out and has a slim chance of failure.
but, it also means people like me will still be single.<br />
<br />
i believe when we first start dating someone, we try to make it
work, even if both involved have alot of uncompromisable
differences. there is that ""what if"" factor that makes us
delusional. and when the relationship doesn't work-out, we wonder
why it didn't. people are very different from one another; all from
vastly different experiences defining who they are. the best way to
grow a relationship is through friendship. but who wants friendship
over romance? i have had more fulfilling friendships than romances.
there isn't one person that can give you all you're looking for. it
makes sense to have friends. in good conscience, i can't date
someone knowing they're only stimulating a couple of my mental and
emotional interaction needs. there is too much emotional
involvement at stake, and this makes room for hurt feelings.
friendship is what i'm looking for. and if all this makes logical
sense to you, i want you to message me and let me know."

"this is interesting:<br />
""the western apache of east-central arizona choose to be silent
[...]. they are silent on 'meeting strangers,' whether these are
fellow western apache or complete outsiders; and strangers, too,
are expected to be silent. the western apache do not easily enter
into new social relationships, and silence is deemed appropriate to
a new relationship, because such a relationship is felt to be
inherently uncertain.""<br />
""silence is maintained until each person [...] becomes accustomed
to the presence of the others.""<br />
""silence is taken to be a proper indication of the shyness that is
expected between two people attempting to enter into a new
relationship.""<br />
""silence is often communicative and its appropriate uses must be
learned. among other things it can communicate respect, comfort,
support, disagreement, or uncertainty. [...] danes appreciate
silence, being able to sit in one another's presence for long
periods of time without feeling any need to talk and, indeed,
finding visitors who insist on talking constantly too demanding.
they feel no urge to fill up silences with idle chatter. in other
societies, e.g., among certain aboriginal peoples in north america,
an acceptable social visit is to arrive at someone's house, sit
around for a while, and then leave with hardly a word spoken all
the while. if you have nothing to say, you do not need to speak,
and there is no obligation to make 'small talk.'""<br />

"- in the forest, high up on the steep shore, and not far from the
open seacoast, stood a very old oak-tree. it was just three hundred
and sixty-five years old, but that long time was to the tree as the
same number of days might be to us; we wake by day and sleep by
night, and then we have our dreams. it is different with the tree;
it is obliged to keep awake through three seasons of the year, and
does not get any sleep till winter comes. winter is its time for
rest; its night after the long day of spring, summer, and
autumn.<br />
<br />
on many a warm summer, the ephemera, the flies that exist for only
a day, had fluttered about the old oak, enjoyed life and felt happy
and if, for a moment, one of the tiny creatures rested on one of
his large fresh leaves, the tree would always say, poor little
creature! your whole life consists only of a single day. how very
short. it must be quite melancholy.<br />
<br />
melancholy! what do you mean? the little creature would always
reply. everything around me is so wonderfully bright and warm, and
beautiful, that it makes me joyous.<br />
<br />
but only for one day, and then it is all over.<br />
<br />
over! repeated the fly; what is the meaning of all over? are you
all over too?<br />
<br />
no; i shall very likely live for thousands of your days, and my
day is whole seasons long; indeed it is so long that you could
never reckon it out.<br />
<br />
no? then i don't understand you. you may have thousands of my
days, but <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=i+have+thousands+of+moments+in+which+i+can+be+merry+and%0ahappy"">
i have thousands of moments in which i can be merry and happy</a>.
does all the beauty of the world cease when you die?<br />
<br />
no, replied the tree; it will certainly last much longer
infinitely longer than i can even think of. well, then, said the
little fly, we have the same time to live; only we reckon
differently.<br />
<br />
and the little creature danced and floated in the air, rejoicing in
her delicate wings of gauze and velvet, rejoicing in the balmy
breezes, laden with the fragrance of clover-fields and wild roses,
elder-blossoms and honeysuckle, from the garden hedges, wild thyme,
primroses, and mint, and the scent of all these was so strong that
the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly.<br />
<br />
the long and beautiful day had been so full of joy and sweet
delights, that when the sun sank low it felt tired of all its
happiness and enjoyment. its wings could sustain it no longer, and
gently and slowly it glided down upon the soft waving blades of
grass, nodded its little head as well as it could nod, and slept
peacefully and sweetly. the fly was dead.<br />

well, i enjoy philosophy, read a lot, and feel i can bullshit with
the best of them (i consider myself a philosopher but prefer the

by nothing i don't mean i don't think about anything at all, i mean
'nothing' in that much deeper, profound sense--that 'no-thing-ness'
of the universe and everything in it. 'thing' is a mind-made
concept of separation, conveniently created to help us make sense
of the world by breaking it into pieces, but really there is no
separation, all is one, a continuous fabric of consciousness
expressed as vibrating energy (mystics and physicists now agree on
this :)). that illusion of separation applies to me, you, everybody
and everything.<br />
for a very humorous take on 'nothing', i recommend checking out
http://www.nothing.net, where they'll even sell you nothing and
deliver it to you, or t-shirts with 'nothing' on it using
black-on-black or white-on-white silk screening. they also have a
facebook group worth checking out.<br />
<br />
by everything i mean the entire cosmos and my place in it, the
history of everything that has led to this moment in time, the vast
and infinite number of possible futures, and how we might, by will,
create the future we choose.<br />
<br />
i spend time regularly doing <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=mindfulness"">mindfulness</a> practices, where i both
think (it's not about not thinking, which is hardly humanly
possible, but does sometimes happen) and just observe that i am
thinking, and that thoughts just happen. i'm not sure how to
describe the witness/observer of thought, other than to say it
feels close to just simple awareness (notice that awareness is
functioning perfectly without any maintenance at all :)).<br />
<br />
i also spend a lot of time thinking about consciousness, and what
some might call '<a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=enlightenment"">enlightenment</a>' or '<a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=spirituality"">spirituality</a>', though
i think both words are overloaded and therefore too charged to get
any kind of point across--besides, what is trying to be described
is by definition beyond words (or at least many scholars, teachers
and leaders have said just that, and i agree).<br />
<br />
i realize all of this may not sound quite in line with my
self-description of not taking myself or life too seriously, but on
this one i love to quote swami beyondananda
(www.wakeuplaughing.com), who points out that 'enlightenment'
implies lightening up :).<br />
<br />
of course, i spend plenty of time thinking about lots of other
things (squirrel!), like what the hell to write in my okcupid
profile, how to change the world for the better while i'm here, how
to improve myself and my life, where to go on my next hiking trip,
how to prepare for the <a class=""ilink"" href=

sometimes it seems as if women and men communicate in different
languages. men seldom talk often about their feelings while women
talk about their feelings to other women but find it hard to get
men to listen. when men hear a woman talk about her feelings in
regard to something that's troubling her, they hear a problem that
requires a solution. trained as the fix it gender, men want to
solve the problem whereas women are asking for sympathy, not
answers. this is frustrating for both genders. - this is a quote
from the contra costa crisis center newsletter and so so
true!<br />

about self-preservation and dignity. its universal message crosses
all boundaries and instills one with the hope that it's not too

live in to empathize with others, we can always empathize with
ourselves. it's an important message, crucial really. and it's
beautifully stated on the album."

evolutionary trait then i'm afraid stephen hawkings' suspicions
that if aliens existed they'd wipe us out would be true. however
hawkings is no anthropologist let alone a cosmo anthropologist, my
hope is that through historical analysis one can prove empathy can
be a positive evolutionary trait at least on earth. how evolution
is defined in the cosmos remains a fun puzzle to consider.<br />
<br />
the other thing i've been thinking a lot about is best practices
for agnostics. while i am no fan of the bureaucratic and political
side effects of religions, i do believe some of their work tends to
help communities a lot. i'm looking for agnostic alternatives to
help build strong community bonds.<br />

about creative ideas and future plans.. although i try not to think
too much, i like the unknown and being open to anything that could

their future.. you just have to live and let life happen!"
what all the fuss is about. jeez!
"i think about fun things to do and trips to plan. i also think
about music alot and how to keep it growing and evolving. i think
about finding a sweet person to share company with on this ride. i
think about how to keep molding my life into what i want it to be."

introspective person. i'm always trying to improve myself, my way

the six things i could never do without...
everything that evokes thought.
... about my homework:)
"i am currently trying to write a zine/comic book (in my spare time)
in preparation for next year's sf zine fest/alt press expo. i'm
also always thinking of fun events (dinner parties, gallery
openings, cooking classes, etc.) to throw with friends and cool
ideas for gatherings and what new dish i can cook up for said
gatherings. other than that i think about how lucky i am and how
great my friend are...""positivity is the key in the lock"""
""
"how i should get a new computer. the exclamation point and # one
key are gone, so i buy things in multiple quantities and my
enthusiasm is never expressed. the 2 (and @) key is about to go
too, and then i'll really be in trouble."
thinking about the future and what's next on my to do list
"where i'm traveling next. for weekend trips - hope to get la,
portland and mexico city in the next couple months. for vacation -
ireland and south africa this year."
what i need to achieve my personal and professional goals
"traveling, food, work, non-work-related work, love, compassion,
pushing my own limits, what i did yesterday, what i'm going to do
with my life today, when the sun will come out next (the bay area
likes to keep one guessing)..."
"the state of the world and current events.<br />
<br />
(and as cliche as it may seem...) where to travel to next."
"people-observing their actions and behaviors<br />
creative projects"
my future
""
"ways to be healthy mentally, spiritually and physically."
"liminality.<br />
other people's loneliness.<br />
education reform.<br />
books.<br />
teaching.<br />
the ways things are connected."
"ocean life, how to cook things without burning them, exposure times
and how late i can stay up when i have to wake up early.<br />
<br />
how narwhals are the unicorns of the sea and how fun it is to say
polyplacaphora!<br />
<br />
i also think about weird shit and then question how i ended up
thinking that. i blame being adhd."
"- how people accomplished much of anything in the realm of research
before the internet. (don't get me wrong, i love libraries, but
seriously think about what you would do if you had a question and
couldn't google it.)<br />
- time travel.<br />
- that rod serling was a fucking genius.<br />
- if banana peels are really as slippery as they seem to be in
cartoons.<br />
- where people sitting around me on muni will be getting off the
bus.<br />
- good costume ideas for burning man and/or halloween.<br />
- why ""blue"" is a legitimate flavor for candy, and no i don't mean
blueberry."
whatever i forget to write down so i'd remember it.
"some girls are great being shy and some are great being silly or
spontaneous. the only way to know who is right for you is to try
meeting them and see where it goes from there."
""
""
"shopping, clothes, makeup, boys, differential equations. you know,
really intelligent, deep things."
my future and goals.
""
""
""
""
""
"how lucky i am to have 2 beautiful cats and a very cool french
bulldog.<br />
how fortunate i am to work for myself and not some other a-hole."
the future~~~
"my future, my dream, my family, my guy (when i have one), my
friend, anything that occupied my mind.."
"who i'd be compatible with... i need a hard-to-find mix of physical
chemistry, mental connection (smart is sexy), morals, values and
just electricity.<br />
<br />
i also think about how i can weave fun into my busy lifestyle...
bachata or salsa classes this week? should i go to the russian
party with vlad? going to em's wedding in kauai... should drop by
honolulu to party with warren? next business trip to europe...
should i take a few days to visit latvia and czech republic?"
"life, love, career"
"how to add more hours to weekends at the expense of weekdays ;)
actually, i just spend a lot of time trying to balance work with
fitness, friends, family and future. but, what makes me happiest in
life is having a #1 bud who's also my lady. so, that's kinda also
taking up my time."
"adventure, beauty, fun, good food, engineering challenges, the
news, history, family, the universe"
""
all sorts of things.
"what to do this coming weekend. seriously, there's so many options
for things to do here that i like to make sure i'm not wasting any
free time"
my next adventure. my next meal.
"how ridiculous it seems that it might be easier to meet someone
through cyberspace rather than out and about in the real world."
""
mistakes
traveling and business ideas.
"a whole bunch of random things... common themes are ""what it would
have been like to live __ years ago,"" and ""how does that actually
work..."""
"what i don't want to do that day ex: gym, work"
"how to combine all of my passions into a career<br />
how polarized our country is<br />
the kids that i counsel<br />
why life is so much more interesting in san francisco than in the
midwest<br />
how i can live in sf as long as it is humanly possible<br />
how i can self actualize - how i can change and am changing my
karma all the time.<br />
how buddhism has changed my life so quickly!<br />
how much i want to experience a deep rich life."
""
whatever project is at hand
"i give a fair amount of time to thinking about feminism(s) and how
to live a life consciously working against oppression. i
occasionally (and regrettably) veer off-course by being overly
facetious.<br />
<br />
to be topical, <a href=""http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2011/06/personals-narrative.html#_ftnref3"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this.</a> d for duh. relatedly: how a/b testing
your dating profile is equal parts effective and creepy."
"memorizing a poem or a song. love lost and gained. how i would
never change a thing even though my mind wants to. when i start
over thinking i remember this quote  thinking about the past
creates sadness, thinking about the future creates anxiety, living
in the moment creates peace"
"nature versus nurture. how i can improve. what makes me and other
people tick. why smells trigger memories before sound does. my next
career move."
"how to be a better person, how to be even more positive. we (might)
only live once. if we live more than once, i certainly don't
remember any of it. so i want my life to be full of happiness, good
people, and adventure."
"which is better, the original song or the glee mashup cover of it?"
my future.
"going back to school, my career, upcoming concerts, how much i'd
love to be sitting on a warm beach somewhere tropical (this last
one happens a lot at work)."
"how to impact my relationships, my work and the world positively
and mindfully"
"books and food and books. budget and creative plans fit their way
in there, too. change, horizons, and daydreams have their space,
too."
my life and what it's all about
"i spend a lot of my time thinking about... well fixing things. i
guess it is part of what i like to call my innate sense of
engineering. i like trying to think of solutions to many problems,
ranging from economic and political to the more technical and
scientific. i also like think of alternate possibilities that
events can take if a single minute change is made. lastly i like
thinking of tactical strategies and maneuvers, especially
space-combat simulations."
"the future. technology has always been about overcoming our own
limits and has been the method by which we have improved our lives.
of course, it's a tool and thus not inherently good or bad. but
production of food and clothing and expansion of communication and
education (yay internet), for instance, have done far more good
over the course of history than guns, bombs, or poisons have done
harm. i would submit as testament to the preceding the mere fact
that we haven't blown ourselves completely up ala fallout (though
we have been fantasizing about it for a long time now).<br />
<br />
did i mention i was a nerd?"
life
"what to make for dinner, what time it is in different time zones,
if i need to start sprinting to the bus stop, how i should really
start cleaning out my email inboxes one day at a time, how to
motivate young people to care about important issues"
