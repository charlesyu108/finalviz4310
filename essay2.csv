smirk on my face.<br />

i've been building things since i was little. remote control cars,
boats, planes, bird traps, bird cages, cat trees, dog houses, fish
ponds, treehouses, bed frames and stuff like that. currently, i
build slightly fancier toys to probe and ask questions about the
very essence of our being. and in the process, help save lives.
well, that's the hope at least.<br />

my grandmama was totally old-school. at the age of 80, as she got
more frail and sick, she would go out into the back yard and chop
wood <em>in order to</em> get rid of a fever. seriously. i'd like
to think i've inherited a bit of whatever you call <em>that</em>
.<br />

but truth be told, i am really good at being okay with just being
okay.<br />

"i like to cycle. i'm not very fast but can stay on the bike a long
time. i've done a lot of ultra-distance riding -- double centuries
and longer. i find it an interesting physical, mental, and
logistical challenge that's unlike what i do during the day sitting
in front of a keyboard.<br />

wouldn't know it from the way i hide inside when it's

i recently discovered baking and <strong>love</strong> it! i've
been making weekly huge batches of goodies to share with my
coworkers. we're not talking toll-house morsels. this is all

usually involves (dark) chocolate and lots of butter! ask me what
i'm baking this week!<br />

offset shots of nearby buildings.<br />

past june. out of thousands of people in the us and canada, i got
in the top 15. the judges said i could have gotten the audience
involved more in my performances so i didn't make it further, but
i'm still proud of myself for making it that far in the first
contest i was ever in. i've been trying to learn the guitar so i
can do both at the same time. hmm... i was an all-star competitive
cheerleader and it was a huge part of my life for 12 years. i was a
flyer (the one they would throw up in the air &amp; catch.) i also
love floor tumbling. it's awesome to be able to flip through the

remember my dad's old, brick-sized gameboy which i would play with
sometimes. nowadays, due to a lack of funds, i generally stick to
the retro gaming circuit...although if one were to get into
japanese games, such as visual novels and such, i do try to keep up
with those. overall, though, being ""good"" at video games is a
subjective thing. i have never won tournaments or been a world
champion or anything. but when you play as much as i have, and as
often as i do, it's hard not to attain some level of skill.<br />
<br />
== giant list of games that i play/have played ==<br />
in no particular order. i'm only listing things that i've played to
a reasonable degree (e.g. ""beat the game""), and without cheating.
like, i've played the legend of zelda: link to the past / ocarina
of time / majora's mask, but i cheated my way through them...<br />
<br />
<strong>if you play/have played any of these games, i would love to
hear from you!</strong><br />

meet them, but i'm working on that.<br />

mine. if i don't put my keys in the exact same place every time,

stars for ufo's, wearing glitter (and combing it out of my hair
with a fork), making bonfires, hiking in the nature, taking my
clothes off in public, riding trains and imagining i were a
mysterious stranger, swimming, finding fun stuff to do on the

i like baking, but i don't do it nearly often enough. i also
experiment a lot when i'm doing it so sometimes it doesn't turn out
right. (but sometimes it does! yay for lime cake!) unfortunately,
my current place doesn't have a very nice oven, so this part of me
is kind of on hold.<br />
<br />
in my spare time, i like dreaming up new worlds and writing about
them and/or designing board games set in them. i'm not completely
horrible at it."
"i can look at all sides of an issue and see things from all
perspectives. i'm also good at changing my mind for the right
reason-- i have strong opinions, but always happy to see the other
side of things, and i'm never too proud to change my views on any
issue.<br />
<br />
if there's something i really want and i'm determined to get it,
there's almost no stopping me. today's dreams are tomorrow's
realities. that's what has enabled me to travel all over the world,
have lots of amazing experiences, and now have a fairly comfortable
life in this beautiful city of san francisco.<br />
<br />
i'm also a really fast typer, and can make a really tasty meal out
of whatever happens to be in the fridge. and i can give a good
massage-- i actually took a course to become a massage

2. scrabble and all its cousins, but i bet you can beat me at

<br />
design. i've got good taste. <em>only once</em> has someone told
me, i really like your boldness, but i think carnival freakshow
might not be the right font for my rsum, and i think that counts

"derping.<br />
<br />
derping is a biological condition that can occur as early as the
onset of puberty to individuals into their late 40's. it is usually
accompanied with herping, resulting in very dangerous situations
(and sometimes arousing) instances of herp derp. derping usually is
an aftereffect symptom of a short-term lapse of lowered intellect,
or brought about by the increased stimulation of the
michaelcerabellum, responsible for controlling the brain waves that
control social awkwardness.<br />
<br />
long term exposure to mentally debilitating activities can lead to
permanent herp derpiness. doctors recommend individuals who value
their intellectual wellbeing stay away from debilitating life
habits such as long-term exposure to youtube comments, social
conservatism, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je5djdgz644"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">birdemic</a>.<br />

<b>listening:</b> i'm good at listening to people's problems. heck,
we all have them and if no one listens to our rants, we're just
going to get worse. sometimes it just take someone willing to
listen to make a situation better.<br />
<br />

while it doesn't need to be the center of every conversation, it's
nice to be good enough friends with someone that you can bicker
with them and still be happy.<br />

the only end to a sexual situation, after all.</b> unless you're
absolutely dead set on sex, heavy foreplay can be very refreshing,
relaxing and a good way to get closer to someone.<br />

<b>computer repair/building</b>: i'm good at finding things to fix
computers with and fixing them. heck, in my eventual occupation
it's going to be somewhat important. i've built and/or maintained
my last few computers, hardware and software wise. i'm not
certified, but i can do quite a bit.<br />
<br />
<b>problem solving:</b> i'm pretty good at analysing mucked
situations and clearing them up, for myself and others. it's a nice
skill to have, eh?<br />

how different minds and personalities have to collaborate and

"i'm really good at something? wow, if you can figure that out let
me know.<br />
<br />
lately, i'm really good at thinking too damned much. fortunately,
this tendency is tempered by a continuing need to progress and
evolve toward bettering myself and my circumstances.<br />
<br />
every so often, i will sporadically utter something profound or
witty unexpectedly. at those times that i have my words come back
to me at a later time, i often pause, dumbfounded. when presented
with such a gem, i can barely believe i said it and i usually have
to convince myself that it really was me. i get this way as i often
edit, rephrase, modify thoughts and words so i see the process that
goes into a simple statement i might make. in other words, blurting
out something that hits the mark the first time is not too common
for me so when it does happen i end up wondering who made that
sharp observation. i guess the old synapses still function
intermittently. please don't ask me how. i'm usually the most
surprised when those ganglia, dendrites, neurons, and axonal
connections work in the first place let alone at all.<br />
<br />
i'm especially good at tuning a <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=guitar"">guitar</a> from completely out of tune to
perfectly in tune with itself using no external tuning pitch. i'm
usually very close to a tuning fork when i check my work.<br />
<br />
in a similarly musical-type fashion, i can sit in rapt attention if
someone reads aloud to me or speaks to me in a language other than
english. i am very good at soaking in what's being read to me or
just marinating myself in the dulcet tones of another
language.<br />
<br />
i seem to have become really good at changing my mind and editing
this profile frequently enough to better convey my thoughts.
unfortunately, my idea of better conveying my thoughts usually
means adding more wording as opposed to subtracting passages. oh
well, it's still a work in progress ...<br />
<br />
i have a natural tendency toward self-deprecating humor. this would
be a source of amusement if most of my somewhat wry statements
weren't true.<br />
<br />
after some recent feedback, i've found that i'm really, really good
at devastating, dead-pan sarcasm heavy on the irony, unexpected
reverses and, especially fat with <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=humor"">humor</a>.<br />
<br />
i will not employ sarcasm as a weapon to hurt anyone or couch
criticisms in humor.<br />
<br />
if i've felt wronged, i'm very good at diplomatically delivering my
concerns in a manner conducive to furthering communication and
minimizing conflict.<br />
<br />
i'm a very good astrologer, a gifted conversationalist and, i have
the ability to teach reasonably well. as a <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=musician"">musician</a>, i can be soulful (love dem
blues), polished and humorously perky.<br />
<br />
most importantly, i'm really good at remaining humble (oh, by the
way, the irony of lauding one's own ability to be humble is not
lost on me. unfortunately, in the spirit of filling out this
particular essay ... well, a bit of self-respect is a small price
to pay). i am very quick to admit a mistake whether someone brings
this to my attention or i see it for myself. when presented with my
own errors, i am quick to validate another's observations and just
as quick to apologize if i've troubled someone. i sublimate my
pride into my actions/work, i do not direct it into bolstering my
ego. i am less likely to become defensive when being approached
about mistakes i've made. i am more organically inclined to step
forward and (however painfully at times) embrace responsibility for
my contributions to any given situation.<br />
<br />
i'm really good at forgetting that what i do for a living is a
consistent, though light work out. i always feel like a sedentary
lump at home because i'm usually spent at the end of my day. then i
go on vacation and my arms turn into wet noodles. then, i can't
wait for my vacation to end so i can get back to work and a regular
work out. i also walk a fair amount at work so i'm able to keep up
a modest walking pace under a variety of conditions.<br />
<br />
another thing i'm really good at is avoiding the phrase ""i work
hard and play hard(er)"" (cringing noticeably). how did i get so
good at avoiding this hell-forged phrase? by loving what i do for a
living. i happened upon a print ad for an internet job placement
service (i imagine enough folks saw this ad campaign) that stated
""find something you'd do for free then get paid for it"". brilliant.
at many points throughtout my life, i've had many different people
encourage me to become an attorney. i've never quite felt inclined
to do so, so i haven't. still, one time during a legal
consultation, the attorney i was working with encouraged me to
become one. after much painful contemplation (have i wasted my
life?, could i have been successful?, and more introspection of
that type), serving as an alternate juror on a murder trial and,
the freak asking-myself-the-right-question-at-the-right-time, i
found that i'd want to do what i'm doing now. i repair (""play with""
so to speak) antique rail equipment and get paid to do so. so, i
play and work at the same time and since i am very willing to put
forth considerable effort into what i do, you could say i work/play
hard. however, when i'm off work, i can put effort into playing or
be peacefully inactive. what i am good at not doing is being a
workaholic when i'm off work. work hard and play hard(er)? dude!
lighten up! learn when to stop being active to the point of
distraction. what does it say about someone who can't be still when
the moment calls for it?<br />
<br />
i have become exceptionally good at realizing the more i think i
know, the less i actually know.<br />
<br />
lastly, i can knead tired muscles into a soothing gelatinous goo
(most people just utter soft moans as they begin to decompress and
melt into my fingertips). i suppose it would be fair to say that my
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=massage"">massage</a> skills and

learning more about their ancient values.<br />

things i'm ""good"" at because i think it makes me sound like a
wanker, but like i said above, brutal honesty time. so here's a
small sample of things i consider myself really good at:<br />
<br />
-reading people/psychology: i majored in psychology for about a
semester and a half before i realized that college really wasn't
for me and dropped out. again, music is my passion so these are the
critical years for me to make a name for myself. college will
always be there as an option, but time never comes back. however,
previous to my college years, i indulged in a lot of independent
study (i cut class a lot, a byproduct of getting my ass beat on a
somewhat frequent basis in high school) and taught myself nlp, and
was introduced to hypnosis by my best friend. i can induce full
trances, cause instant amnesia, waking hallucinations, and natural
anesthesia. have you ever watched lie to me? cal lightman is based
on dr. paul ekman, and i'm a huge fan of his work in
micro-expressions. in 2009 i was certified through his program as
an expert in micro-expressions recognition, and i use that skill to
this day.<br />
<br />
-magic/sleight of hand: i used to do magic a lot back in my teens.
it was part of my growing up phase and it was basically an ego
thing. i wanted to be able to do something no one else could,
regardless of age or education. i spent much of my freshman year in
high school cheating in lunchroom blackjack games, and if 4 latino
gang members couldn't catch me, you sure as hell won't if i break
out the knuckle busting moves. i got a few awards for magic, and as
of this writing i still hold the title of best magician in marin
county and san francisco as a result of competitions i participated
in.<br />

explanation):<br />

friends are massage therapists. i give a bomb ass massage.<br />

no good at. for example, i can't pop a wheelie on a bike to save my
life, and my nobel prize count is holding steady at zero. my skin
tone speaks volumes about my tanning skills. i can't speak either
dutch or french, making me a poor choice if you're looking for a
travel partner for that big belgium trip you've always dreamed of.
lastly, my freestyle rapping skills have been described as mediocre
at best.<br />

on the plus side, i'm great at scanning the ground for typos in the
street names embedded in sf sidewalks (some highlights have been
sacramento spelled ""<em>sacarmneto</em>"" and head as
""<em>haed</em>""). my road-tripping skills are superb, in case
you've been looking for someone to explore the backroads with. i
always have a stash of $2 bills that i like to give out as tips.
i'm pretty consistent at flossing, and i've been to every state,
with the exception of hawaii and south dakota. i can't say i'm
really good at photography, but i certainly really enjoy it! if
you're looking for someone who's great at remembering to bring his
own bags into the grocery store, i might be your man. lastly, i
guess you could call me a morning person, but i'm not one of those
annoying morning people who's all chipper and says ""well hello,
sleepyhead!"" to non-morning people before telling them about all
the things they've accomplished already that day. nobody likes that

problem solving - my job relies on me to have sound logical
deductive reasoning skills which i try to apply (...with varying
success..) to lots of scenarios.<br />
<br />
conversation - i like to bounce things off people and hear what
their opinions and thoughts are. differences of opinion are cool
since it makes me consider what i think carefully."

so if i don't) keeping it somewhere in my brain until another time

likelihood of something happening and the price is right."

<br />
i also brew my own beer, make my own red wine vinegar, and as soon
as i get everything in order would love to start meddling with
distillation (home made absinthe anyone)?<br />

<br />
i could've been a good writer, not of pop books like harry
potter's, but of serious literature and philosophy. there is no big
money there--excuse me for my vulgarity-- and it might've just been
my self indulgence (please commend me for my restraint from
personal gratification=:). so i pursued a career path in technical
business and then finance instead. please excuse my vulgarity
again, but presently i do wonder if the feel one gets doing
transcendental meditation sitting on one billion us dollars, a feel
which i might very well never know (unless the us dollar is
devalued, say, 99.9999999 percent), might be somehow different from
doing the meditation sitting on a stone inside a cave in the
himalayas, a feel which i did know. (there is little greed involved
here. it might very well just be an temporary existential whim, one
of many for any of us. it will be nice to experience it, but no
biggie if we do not. we can't taste every thing in the world in
this one eye blink of time we call life, can we?)<br />
<br />
following is one of my writing samples put on another site. the

be careful and don't run to me crying later and say that i did not

have to study at least for a dozen of weeks first. what'll be the
economy behind that, dude? ( or less likely, dudess? )<br />

2. the ""that's your boyfriend/girlfriend game"". <b>juvenile</b>?
sure. funny? totally. other variations may include ""that's your
mom"", ""that's your grandpa"", or ""that's you in 20 years"".<br />

would naturally take much more time before jumping in the bed

satisfying romantic event like sex when holding hands, hugging,
kissing, cuddling and taking lovely strolls together can be better
than just getting it on.<br />

nerdy and somewhat removed from the norm. music is a complex and
incredible thing with its own world. i enjoy this world, but not

easily. i also play piano, clarinet, and ukulele- none of which are
as developed a skill as singing. i'm also trying to learn the
violin, but i sound genuinely terrible at it so far.<br />

became fluent in spanish, but i did. i didn't declare myself fluent
until my native spanish speaking friends told me, katern, eres
bilingue. i loved learning spanish and learning all about chilean
culture.<br />

(2) i am a graduate of the <a class=""ilink"" href=

to earn my degree in environmental studies."

a perfectionist when it comes to work so much so that i've managed

watching (live or on tv) and playing. my absolute faves are hockey,
basketball, volleyball, international football (go manchester
united!), etc. i like football and baseball as well, but the niners
are run by an idiot and the giants are better live while drinking
beer. i love going out with friends to drink and even have a
cocktail named after me at one of my local haunts."
"pursuing things that matter to me - regardless of how hard it could
be. i am a strong believer in an old saying ""if you want something
badly enough, you will get it"". i am also good at making others
laugh - and a great listener to my friends when they need me, be it
the lows or highs. not a perfect cook, but i am proud of my cooking
when i set my mind to do so (you just have to convince me of a good
reason)!"

though i'm always busy, i am fully present in whatever i'm doing. i
think this helps me enjoy every aspect of my life - the good parts
and the tough parts. we only get one shot at this life (i haven't
quite made the leap to truly believing in reincarnation), so i like
to live each moment knowing that this is my life. i don't want to
wait for some future point when i can finally stop, look around,
and think ""i've made it"" because then it'll probably be too
late.<br />

beyond that, i am good at laughing and making other people laugh.

former). i've been told that i am a catalyst for change and that i

""i think the essence of the scientific method is the willingness to
admit you're wrong, the willingness to abandon ideas that don't
work, and the essence of religion is not to change anything; the
supposed truths are handed down by some revered figure and nobody
is supposed to make any progress beyond that because all the truth
is thought to be in hand. my sense is that the scientific way of
thinking, questioning, some delicate mix of creative encouragement
of new ideas, and the most rigorous and skeptical scrutiny of new
and old ideas, i think that is the path to the future, not just for
science, but for all human institutions. we have to be willing to
challenge because we are in desperate need of change.""<br />
-carl sagan<br />

""so the first biological lesson of history is that life is
competition. competition is not only the life of trade, it is the
trade of life--peaceful when food abounds, violent when the mouths
outrun the<br />
food. animals eat one another without qualm; civilized men consume
one another by due process of law. co-operation is real, and
increases with social development, but mostly because it is a tool
and form of competition; we co-operate in our group--our family,
community, club, church, party, ""race,"" or nation--in order to
strengthen our group in its competition with other groups.
competing groups have the qualities of competing individuals:
acquisitiveness, pugnacity, partisanship, pride. our states, being
ourselves multiplied, are what we are; they write our natures in
bolder type, and do our good and evil on an elephantine scale. we
are acquisitive, greedy, and pugnacious because our blood remembers
millenniums through which our forebears had to chase and fight and
kill in order to survive, and had to eat to their gastric capacity
for fear they should not soon capture another feast. war is a
nation's way of eating. it promotes co-operation because it is the
ultimate form of competition. until our states become members of a
large and effectively protective group they will continue to act
like individuals and<br />
families in the hunting stage.""<br />

let's talk about what your good about
"due to my interest in enlightenment, and subsequent involvement in
buddhism, i've learned that, at the very least, there's another way
of looking at things. rather than looking at them as being problems
that were here already, i practice seeing the universe as a name
i've used to describe the results of my actions from my countless
previous lifetimes. that way i don't blame anybody, or anything,
for my problems. however, that isn't to say that i wouldn't ask a
person verbally abusing me to stop (to begin with)."

each other)"

evident whether it's something that's happening in my life or in a
friend's life.<br />
*listening! or at least i tend to think so<br />

astrology)...at least that's what it feels like. dogs chase
rabbits...<br />

*having fun. having fun is a better release for me than a spa visit
or a massage, even though it is hard to say no to the latter. i
don't put an age limit on what's fun: i would enjoy flying a kite,
swinging on a swing set, riding a horse, racing go karts, dancing,
eating at a new restaurant (i love food! - i have once or twice
been labeled a foodie), visiting new places off and on the map,
wine tasting, taking classes to learn something new, or seeing a

losing weight, for example. prior to last february, i had never
tried going on a diet before, but when i did i went from 200 lbs.
to 160 in a little over 4 months. in a related issue, i started
cooking for myself regularly at about the same time, and i've
gotten a lot of compliments about my cooking. really, all i do is
read recipes and follow directions, but it seems to turn out well.
i'm a good listener, and i enjoy drawing and creative writing on
